# Using sentiment analysis to visualize character arcs in ATLA TVÂ series
A beginner end-to-end NLP data science project.

# Motivation and project description
I was curious if sentiment scores could be used to visualize character arcs. If so, sentiment analysis could be used to help writers evaluate character development in their work.

For this project, I decided to analyze one of my favorite shows, Avatar: The Last Airbender.

See how I:
1) Scraped Avatar: The Last Airbender fansite for episode transcripts using BeautifulSoup
2) Analyzed character dialogue with VADER (a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool)
3) Visualized the sentiment scores with Plotly Express

The outcome of this project are two [interactive visualizations](https://plotly.com/~ritakalach/4/) that show the sentiment progression of six main characters. For more information, read the accompanying [blog post.](https://medium.com/data-comet/atla-sentiment-analysis-43f26edddad2)
