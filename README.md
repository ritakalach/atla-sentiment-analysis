# Using sentiment analysis to visualize character arcs in ATLA TVÂ series
A beginner end-to-end NLP data science project.

# Motivatin and project description
I was curious if sentiment scores could be used to visualize character arcs. If so, sentiment analysis could be used to help writers evaluate character development in their work.

2) analyzed character dialogue with VADER (a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool),
3) and visualized the sentiment scores with Plotly Express.

The outcome of this project are two visualizations that show the sentiment progression of six main characters:
