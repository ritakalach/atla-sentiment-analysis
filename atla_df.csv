1,The Boy in the Iceberg,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=101," (whispering in a weak voice) I need to ask you something. (still whispering) Please... come closer. (in a normal, even excited voice) Will you go penguin sledding with me? What's going on here? (batting the spear anway, absently) I'm not sure. Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy. Haha! You're okay! This is Appa, my flying bison. Don't worry. It'll wash out. So, do you guys live around here? I'm A... aaaahhhh... ahhhhhh.... aaah aaah aaah AAAAAAACHOOOO! I'm Aang. (He sniffles and rubs his nose.)  Really? It felt higher that that. Sure am. Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift. Okay. First time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip yip! (shaking the reigns again) Come on, Appa. Yip yip. Appa's just tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see. Oh... I was smiling? Hey. Whatcha thinkin' about? (looking disconcerted) Uhh... no. I didn't know him... I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry. Sleep tight. Aaahhh! Whaaaa! Uh... why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me? 'Extinct'? It's not for stabbing. (He creates a jet of air that sucks the staff back into his hand.) It's for airbending. Not magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly. Check again! (as he crashes) Oof! You're a waterbender! (slurring) Sthee? Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff. (gesturing over his shoulder at the toilet) Wow! Everything freezes in there! What war? (He hops down off of Appa) What are you talking about? PENGUIN! Haha! Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding? Oof! Heh heh, I have a way with animals. (He puts his arms out and waddles in imitation of the four flippered penguins) Yarp! Yarp yarp! Yarp! Yarp yarp! Yarp! You got a deal! Just one little problem. I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you? This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you. But you forget I have a flying bison. Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're gonna find you a master! Well, you think about it. But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins? You still are a kid! Whoa... what is that? If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear. Okay, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. I've never seen any war. I don't know... a few days, maybe? What? That's impossible. Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you? A hundred years! I can't believe it. I did get to meet you. Huh? What's that you said about booby traps? Uh oh. Hold on tight!"," Sokka, look! (trying to retain control of the globe of water) But Sokka! I caught one! Hey! It's not magic. It's waterbending, and it's- You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water. and  Watch out! Go left! Go left! You call that left? So it's my fault? You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained... Ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you! Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier! I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, NOT PLEASANT! No, that's it. I'm done helping you. From now on, you're on your own! You mean I did that? He's alive! We have to help. Stop it! What? What is it? Uh... sure. I guess. Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that evil look in his eye. The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name. (gasping) You're an airbender! We'd love a ride! Thanks! (She gets on Appa.)  Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know... before you freeze to death? Why are you smiling at me like that? Hey. I guess I was wondering – your being an airbender and all – if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar. Okay. Just curious. Goodnight. (voice over) Aang! Aang, wake up! (He wakes up, gasping) It's okay. We're in the village now. Come on, get ready. Everyone's waiting to meet you. Aang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang. Aang, this is my grandmother. That was amazing. Well... sort of. Not yet. I told you! He's the real thing, Gran Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me. But he's special. I can tell. I sense he's filled with much wisdom. Have you seen Aang? Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago. Aang? (giggles) Hahaha... Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending. (looking away in sadness) No. You're looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole. Maybe. But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly 'turn right at the second glacier.' It's on the other side of the world. (happily) That's... (then uncertain) I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before. (mock teacherly tone) Okay, listen closely my young pupil. Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. Observe. I haven't done this since I was a kid! (deathly serious) A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people. Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it. The ship could be booby trapped. This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks. Aang, how long were you in that iceberg? I think it was more like a hundred years! Think about it. The war is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there that whole time. It's the only explanation. (kneeling next to him) I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this. (smiles) Come on. Let's get out of here. Aang? Let's head back. This place is creepy."," It's not getting away from me this time. Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish. (whispers) Shhh. Katara, you're gonna scare it away. Mmmm... I can already smell it cookin'! (very exasperated) Ugh! Why is it that every time you play with magic water I get soaked? Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah. Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself. Ahhh! You don't like my steering. Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice. I knew I should have left you home. Leave it to a girl to screw things up. (noticing the cracking iceberg) Uh... Katara? Katara! Settle down! Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara. Yup. Congratulations. Katara! Get back here! We don't know what that thing is! (raising his spear at the boy) Stop! Ahh! You tell us! How'd you get in the ice? (Poking Aang with his spear) And why aren't you frozen? What is that thing? Right. And this is Katara, my flying sister. Ewww! Aahh!!! Ugh! Don't answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light? He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy. (incredulous) You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air. Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders... I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense. Oh, no... I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster. Wow. That was truly amazing. (disgusted) Uuuuugh. (grabbing Aang's staff) What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this. You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly. (gasping) My watchtower! Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long. Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing. For without courage, how can we call ourselves men? Listen! Until your fathers return from the war, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe. And that means no potty breaks. (sighing) Okay... who else has to go? Ugh! Katara, get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only. Stop! Stop it right now! (To Aang) What's wrong with you? We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on. You're kidding, right? He's kidding, right?"," Finally. (He turns to address someone o.c.) Uncle, do you realize what this means? It means my search - it's about to come to an end. That light came from an incredibly powerful source. It has to be him! (exploding in anger) I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar. Helmsman, head a course for the light! Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does. This coward's hundred years in hiding are over. Ha! Heeya! Enough. I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set. I'm more than ready. Grrrr... huh! (He blasts one of the guards backwards with a gout of fire.) The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender. He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements. I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him. You WILL teach me the advanced set! (voice over) The last airbender. (Cut to a profile view of Zuko looking through his telescope) Quite agile for his old age. Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar... ...as well as his hiding place.",,
2,The Avatar Returns,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=102," Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well... (putting his hand to his head as if trying to puzzle out the thought) ...we “boobied” right into it. Don't blame Katara! I brought her there. (Looking downcast) It's my fault. (smiling earnestly) You should try it sometime. (momentarily confused, then brightening) I am? Great! Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family. Thanks for penguin sledding with me. (putting a hand on Appa) Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders. (Thinking) Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to that.  It was nice meeting everyone. Come on, Appa, you can do it! Yip! Yip!(sadly) I'll miss you too. Come on, boy. Yeh, I liked her too. The village! (He slides down off his perch) Appa, wait here! Hey Katara. Hey Sokka. Looking for me? Well, you're just a teenager. If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone? Don't worry, Katara, it'll be okay. (They push him forward roughly) Take care of Appa for me until I get back. So... I guess you never fought an airbender before. I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back. (panting) You haven't seen my staff around, have you?  Thanks anyway! (whispering) Sorry... My staff! Appa! (drained) Hey Katara. Hey Sokka. Thanks for coming. I dropped my staff. (sitting cross legged on the bridge of the saddle, a slightly sad expression on his face) I don't know. I just sort of... did it. Because... I never wanted to be. (looking down sadly) And how am I going to do that? That's what the monks told me. (now smiling) We can learn it together! (producing a scroll) All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some serious business to attend to (he airbends himself over to them and opens the scroll to reveal a map) here, here, and here. Here (pointing to the eastern Earth Kingdom) we'll ride the hopping llamas. Then waaaay over here (pointing to a spot on the southern Air Nomad islands) we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. Then back over here we'll ride the hog-monkeys. They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!"," Aang didn't do anything. It was an accident. (angrily) Sokka, you're making a mistake. (motioning to Aang) Aang is not our enemy! Don't you see? Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time. Fun. Grandmother, please, don't let Sokka do this. Then I'm banished too! C'mon, Aang, let's go! To find a waterbender! Aang is taking me to the North Pole! So, you're leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye? Where will you go? (cutting her off angrily) You happy now? There goes my one chance of becoming a waterbender! Sokka, get out of the way! Aang? No, Aang! Don't do this! We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe; now we have to save him. Why can't you realize that he's on our side? If we don't help him, no one will. I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and I— (with a happy gasp) Sokka! He's not my— (turning to the canoe) There's no way we're gonna catch a war ship with a canoe.  Appa! Please, Appa, we need your help. Aang needs your help. Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa. (Coaxingly) Come on. Don't you wanna save Aang? (ecstatic) You did it, Sokka! (hysterical) Aang! No! (voice-over as Aang sinks) Aang! Aang! AANG! (incredulously) Did you see what he just did?(worried) Aang! Are you okay? Hurry up, Sokka! How did you do that? With the water? It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar? But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war. According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right? Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending. And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way. Then we're in this together. What's there?"," (pointing at Aang) I knew it! You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you? Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy! (The children walk away from Aang and towards Sokka and Gran Gran.) The foreigner is banned from our village! No! I'm keeping my promise to Dad. I'm protecting you from threats like him! Fun? We can't fight firebenders with fun! Get out of our village. Now! (pointing at Katara) Where do you think you're going? Katara! (She stops) Would you really choose him over your tribe? Your own family? Let's see your bison fly now, air boy. Yeh, I thought so. All right! Ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now! (cutting him off forcefully and pointing to the fortifications) And no potty breaks! (disappointed at the tower's collapse) Oh man! Ohhh, man! (dryly) Hi...Aang. Thanks for comin'. No way. Katara, I— Katara! Are you gonna talk all day or are you comin' with me? Get in. We're going to save your boyfriend. Whatever. Yeah... okay, Gran. You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya? (drearily) Go. Fly. Soar. Up. Ascend. Elevate. What was it that kid said? Yee-ha? Hup hup? Wahoo? Uh... yip yip? He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's—! (Katara gives him a smug look. Then, nonchalantly) I mean, big deal, he's flying. Now that was some waterbending! Well, I couldn't let you have all the glory. Got it! Ha! That's from the Water Tribe! Katara! (to himself) I'm just a guy with a boomerang; I didn't ask for all this flying and magic. Yip yip! Yip yip! (somewhat dreamily) I'd like that. I'd really like that."," Where are you hiding him? He'd be about this age? Master of all elements? I know you're hiding him! (incredulous) You're the airbender? You're the Avatar? I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training. Meditating. You're just a child! Head a course to the Fire Nation. I'm going home. This staff will make an excellent gift for my father. I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. Take the Avatar to the prison hold. And (shoving the staff in Iroh's direction) take this to my quarters. Looks like I underestimated you. What is that? Shoot them down! That kid, Uncle, just did this. (Shot widens to show the prow buried in ice) I won't underestimate him again. Dig this ship out and follow them! (In the background, some soldiers are using controlled firebending to thaw out their compatriots frozen by Katara) As soon as you're done with that.",,
3,The Southern Air Temple,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=103," (while adjusting Appa's reins) Wait 'til you see it, Katara. The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world. That's why I'm so excited! I know, but I need to see it for myself. Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple here we come! Sokka! Wake up! (He begins to run the stick up and down Sokka's sleeping bag.) There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag! (pokes his head out from behind Sokka.) Great! You're awake. Let's go. Oh, that was food? I used it to start the campfire last night. Sorry. The Batola mountain range! We're almost there! What about 'em? (close-up of Aang's face, which relaxes into hopeful optimism) Just because no one has seen an airbender doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all. (Cut to a front view of both, sitting up front.) They probably escaped. You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison. Right, Appa? (voice-over) Yip yip!  There it is... the Southern Air Temple. (to Appa) We're home, buddy. We're home. So that's where my friends and I would play airball! And... over there would be where the bison would sleep... and...  This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison. Now there's just a bunch of weeds.  I can't believe how much things have changed. Hahaha! Aang seven, Sokka zero!  (approaching happily with the ball) Okay! What is it? Nice one. But enough practicing. We have a whole temple to see!  (calls from o.c.) Hey guys!  I want you to meet somebody. Monk Gyatso, the greatest airbender in the world. He taught me everything I know.  Hmm... This whole Avatar thing... maybe the monks made a mistake. (o.c.) But Gyatso, how do I know if I'm ready for this? (excitedly as he jumps up to turn and face Gyatso fully) Who is it? (smiling) All right. and  Yeah. (moves forward to go into the Temple)  (climbing the steps.) The Air Temple Sanctuary. There's someone I'm ready to meet.  It's not impossible. I survived in the iceberg for that long. Katara, whoever's in there might help me figure out this Avatar thing! The key, Sokka, is airbending. (calling inside) Hello? Anyone home?  (uncertain) I'm not sure, but it feels like I know them somehow. Look! (He points to a statue.) That one's an airbender! That's the Avatar cycle. Wow! There's so many! (dazed) Huh? That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me. I'm not sure... I just know it somehow. and  Lemur! Don't listen to him! You're going to be my new pet. (calling) Wait! Come back! Hey! Come back!  Come on out, little lemur. That hungry guy won't bother you anymore. (surprised) Firebenders? They were here? Gyatso...  (tired) I'm sorry. (sadly) But you were right. And if firebenders found this temple that means they found the other ones, too. I really am the last airbender.  (still looking at the statue) How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him? Looks like you made a new friend, Sokka. (as the lemur scurries up his chest to perch on his head.) Hey little guy. You, me, and Appa. (View switches to frontal shot of the three.) We're all that's left of this place. We have to stick together. Katara, Sokka...   (Camera switches to Katara and Sokka, the latter's mouth still full, a fruit in his hand.)  ... say hello to the newest member of our family.  (surprised as the lemur jumps off camera and returns a second later with a fruit.) Momo."," (cautious) Aang, I know you're excited, but it's been a hundred years since you've been home. It's just that a lot can change in all that time. (uneasy) Aang? Before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders. (close-up of Katara's face.) Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless. They killed my mother and they could have done the same to your people. I know it's hard to accept. Aang, it's amazing! You're lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple and all you can think about is food? (Camera cuts to follow them from above and behind.)  What's wrong? (seeing the helmet, accusingly) Fire Nation. (turning to call to Aang) Aang, there's something you need to see. (uncertainly) Uh... just a new waterbending move I learned. (walking away from him) I can for Aang's sake.  If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated. (coming forward and placing a hand on Aang's shoulder.) You must miss him. Where are you going? But Aang... no one could have survived in there for a hundred years. Good point. Who are all these people? (pointing) And this one's a waterbender. They're lined up in a pattern. Air, water, earth and fire. Of course! They're Avatars. All these people are your past lives, Aang. It's true. When the Avatar dies he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle. Aang, snap out of it! Who is that? There's no writing. How do you know his name? (exasperated) You're making a sound! (worried) Aang! What happened? Oh no, it's his avatar spirit! He must have triggered it! I'm gonna try and calm him down. (shouting calmly) Aang, I know you're upset...  ... and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom. Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, but you still have a family. Sokka and I, we're your family now. It's okay. It wasn't your fault. Everything's packed. You ready to go? Maybe you'll find a way. What are you going to name him?"," Sleep now... temple later... (startled) Aaahhh! Get it off! Get it off! Aaahhh!  (annoyed) Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right? I'm trying to find us some food.  Hey! Who ate all my blubbered seal jerky? (incredulous) You WHAT? Awww, no wonder the flames smelled so good. So where do I get something to eat?  I'm just a simple guy with simple needs. So, uh, this airball game? How do you play?  (getting up painfully) Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt. Katara, check this out. We should tell him. You know, you can't protect him forever. Katara, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't. Who's that? (Pops out from behind Aang eagerly.) And whoever's in there might have a medley of delicious, cured meats! I don't suppose you have a key? Statues?! That's it? Where's the meat?  (skeptical) Past lives? Katara, you really believe in that stuff? You were a firebender? No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met. (growls in frustration) You just couldn't get any weirder! (whispering) Firebender. Nobody make a sound. Shhhh! (whispering, ready with his weapon) That firebender won't know what hit 'em. (cut to Sokka, drooling) Dinner... Not if I get him first! I wanna eat you! Oof!  Hey! No Fair! (pulling back the curtain) Hey Aang, you find my dinner yet?  Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur, okay? (He sees the skeleton and does a doubletake.) Oh, man... come on, Aang, everything will be all right. Let's get out of here. Aang! Come on, snap out of it! Aaahhh! He found out firebenders killed Gyatso. (Hanging onto the rubble, trying not to get blown away.) Well, do it before he blows us off the mountain!  (gently) Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you. Promise. (mouth full) Can't talk. Must eat."," Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible. I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail. (turning on his uncle angrily) Don't mention his name on these docks! Once word gets out that he's alive every firebender will be out looking for him and I don't want anyone getting in the way. (with distaste) Captain Zhao. Yes... you wouldn't believe what happened. (He gives his uncle a sideways glance and immediately passes the buck.) Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened. (uncomfortable) Uh, yes! Right into an Earth Kingdom ship. Sorry, but we have to go. (Cut to Zuko's upper body.) If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool.  (cut to Zuko.) We haven't found him yet. (still looking away) No. Nothing. (defiantly) I haven't found anything. It's like you said. The Avatar probably died a long time ago. Come on, Uncle, we're going. I underestimated him once, but it will not happen again. (alarmed) Commander Zhao, I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I... Why? Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you? (Zuko stands in defiance.) Don't underestimate me, Zhao. I will capture the Avatar before you.  You're wrong. Once I deliver the Avatar to my father he will welcome me home with honor and restore my rightful place on the throne. That's not true. (With a cry of indignation, launches himself to his feet, bringing his face within inches of Zhao's.) Maybe you'd like one to match! An agni kai. At sunset. I will never forget.  (standing up) I refuse to let him win.  Next time you get in my way, I promise I won't hold back. (quietly) Did you really mean that, Uncle?",,
4,The Warriors of Kyoshi,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=104," (turning his head back to answer Sokka) Weeelll, I know it's near water... Momo, marbles please. (smiling eagerly and cupping the marble in his two hands) Hey Katara! Check out this airbending trick! (crushed that she did not notice) You didn't even look. But I'm not doing it now. Don't worry, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants! (shading his face and looking out over the water) But Appa's tired already, aren't you boy? I said, aren't you boy?  (gasps excitedly and points out towards the water) LOOK! (A giant koi fish jumps out of the water.) That's why we're here... (Aang strips down to his underwear.)... elephant koi. And I'm going to ride it. Katara, you've gotta watch me! (Aang dives into the water. A second later he leaps out again with a shocked expression on his face.) COLD! Yeeaaaah! Woohoo! (Aang is laughing, ecstatic as he rides the giant koi fish. A couple of other fish follow behind, leaping in and out of the water.  Aww, man... Aaahhh! I don't know. (thrown to the ground) Ugh! (apologetically) It's my fault. I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi. This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi! I know her because I'm the Avatar. That's me! Now... check this out!  All right! Dessert for breakfast! (stuffing his face and talking with his mouth full) These people sure know how to treat an Avatar! Mmm... Katara you've got to try these! (Aang offers Katara a sweet)  (looking off screen) Sokka, what's your problem? EAT! But you're always hungry! What's he so angry about? It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment. I'm sure we'll be fine. Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town? (Aang turns around to look out the window at the two villagers working on Avatar Kyoshi's statue.) They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor! Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk. There she is, girls. Me in a past life. Excuse me for a second, ladies. Actually, I can't right now. I promised the girls that I'd give them a ride on Appa. Why don't Well, neither does carrying your basket. I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet. I can't put my finger on it, but there's something I really like about this place. (calling back) Just a second, Koko! It didn't. You know what I think? You just don't want to come because you're jealous. Jealous that we're having so much fun without you. It is a little ridiculous, but I understand. (giggling and racing off) Hey Sokka! Nice dress! Katara, remember how the unagi almost got me yesterday? Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be REAL dangerous. (surprised) You're not going to stop me? (crossing his arms peevishly) I will. I know it's great. I'm glad you're glad. Fine! I'm sure it will be here any second! (He looks down at the water.) What about this? (Aang suspends and spins the marble between his two hands.)  Where're you going? Don't leave! (excitedly waving) Katara! You came! Back there you acted like you didn't care. Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk. (grinning widely as he begins to swim toward shore) On my way! (weakly) Katara... don't ride the unagi. Not fun. Hey! Over here! (upset) Look what I brought to this place.  Yes, it is. These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me. (hanging his head) I'll call Appa. Appa, yip yip! (clearly expecting a lecture from Katara) I know, I know. That was stupid and dangerous."," (absentmindedly) That's great, Aang. (stops her sewing and looks at him) That's great! What does me being a girl have to do with sewing? (with exaggerated happiness) All done with your pants! And look what a great job I did! He's right. At this rate we won't get to the North Pole until spring. (waving) Woo! He looks pretty good out there. (Katara turns to see look at something happening off screen.) No, Appa! Don't eat that! (Katara hurries off screen as Sokka continues to watch Aang.)  What's wrong? (screams) Get out of there! AANG! What was that thing? (thrown to the ground) Uhh... (quickly) No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes. (tersely) Aang... do some airbending... Well, maybe just a bite... (She takes the candy from Aang as Momo seizes the opportunity and snatches another from his other hand.)  He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday. (smugly) Right. And then they kicked your butt. Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long. Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar. I just hope it doesn't all go to your head. (turning around) Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? It's a little heavy. (irritated) What do you mean you can't? (continuing to pick up vegetables) Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun. It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon. (flatly) Aangy... 'Simple monk,' huh? I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head. Jealous? Of what? (ferociously putting vegetables into her basket) That's ridiculous. (without looking up from her bowl) Yeah. (still not looking up from her bowl) Good for you. (still not looking up) Nope. Have fun. Great. I'm glad you know. Good! I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried. I'm sorry. (affectionately) Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk! (calling from the shore) Hang on, Aang! Zuko! Wake up, Aang!  Get inside. It's not your fault. Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way. I know it's hard, but you did the right thing. Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. They're going to be okay, Aang.  (as he dives off) What are you doing?! Yes, it was."," You have no idea where you're going, do you? (flatly) I guess we're getting close then. (waves his arm dismissively in Aang and Katara's direction) Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing. Simple girls are better at fixing pants than guys, and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. It's just the natural order of things. Wait! I was just kidding! I can't wear these! (He sticks his arm through the big hole in the seat of his pants.) Katara, PLEASE! We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out? Yeah, that was real convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten ton magical monster. Are you kidding? The fish is doing all the work. (yells) There's something in the water! Aang's in trouble. (yells) Aang! Come back here! AANG! (getting up and wiping his hands together) Well, let's not stick around and find out. Time to hit the road. (thrown to the ground) Oof... Or we could stay a while... (close-up of his angry face) Show yourselves, cowards! (straining at his bonds) Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us? (in laughing disbelief) Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down. Not hungry. They snuck up on me! (getting up angrily) Sneak attacks don't count! (pacing around the room, gesticulating wildly to the air) Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. I'm not scared of any girls. (He has paced around to the breakfast table and is ferociously grabbing sweets off it. He begins to lower his voice and talk to himself.) Who do they think they are anyway? (Sokka grunts and shoves a sweet into his mouth. He walks off camera and out of the room.) Mmm... this is tasty. (in a bit of an arrogant manner) Sorry ladies! Didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson. (He stretches his arms and waist.) I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout? (He bends over and grabs his knees with his hands.)  (flippantly) It's all right. I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception. (He rotates his shoulders.)  True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village. Oh... well... I mean... I... Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to. All right, you stand over there. (He grasps her shoulders and pushes her back a little, but Suki doesn't move. He doesn't seem to notice or care.) This may be a little tough, but try to block me. (rubbing his shoulder) Heh heh... good. Of course, I was going easy on you. Let's see if you can handle this! (angrily) That does it! (hesitantly) Uh... hey, Suki. No... I... well, let me explain. (kneeling in humility) I would be honored if you would teach me. (quietly) I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was wrong. Please make an exception. I won't let you down. (quickly) Of course! Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little... girly. (standing proudly) Bravery and honor. (slightly losing his balance) I think I'm starting to get it. (crossing his arms in a ""so there"" manner) Hmm... (laughing and pointing his finger at her) I got you! Admit I got you!  Hey, I'm not a... oh, whatever! I guess training's over. What about, ""I'm sorry""? I treated you like a girl when I should have treated you like a warrior."," (in a dangerously silky voice) The only reason you should be interrupting me is if you have news about the Avatar.  (calmly) Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Now whatever you have to say, I'm sure that I can take it.  (enraged) WHAT?! (snatching the map from Iroh's hand) Give me the map! How am I gonna find him, Uncle?  He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering. (standing up and speaking angrily) The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island? (Zuko walks out of the room while speaking to Iroh.) Uncle, ready the rhinos. He's not getting away from me this time. I was going to save it for later! (He storms off screen with his meal.)  I want the Avatar alive. Come out, Avatar! You can't hide from me forever! (to his men) Find him. Nice try, Avatar! But these little girls can't save you. Finally! (to his men) Back to the ship! Don't lose sight of them!",,
5,The King of Omashu,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=105," The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu! I used to always come here to visit my friend, Bumi. Well, let's go slow pokes! The real fun is inside the city! So, what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache? Ohh, this is so itchy! (To Appa) How do you live in this stuff? (Appa grunts at him in response.)  (picking up his staff and using a fake, old man voice) Now let's get to skippin', young whippersnappers! The big city awaits. You guys are gonna love Omashu. The people here are the friendliest in the world. Just keep smiling... My business is my business, young man, and none of yours! I've got half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside! Name's Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids. Good idea!  This is the Omashu delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and chutes. Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down. (Cut back to the group.)  They do get their mail on time, but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes... Umm... the mail system? A package sending system? Bumi, you're a mad genius! One ride, then we're off to the North Pole, Airbender's honor. I'm on it! I'm on it! Yeh! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster! Sorry! (sheepishly) Two cabbages please. Huh? Thanks, but I don't eat meat. I'm from... Kangaroo Island. Okay! You caught me. I'm the Avatar, doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out (looks under the table), no firebenders here. So, good work everybody. (Puts his arms around his companions and together they stand.) Love each other, respect all life and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time! He did say it was newly refurbished. I wonder what these challenges are gonna be. (smiling and pointing o.c.) The air vents! We can't, but Momo can. Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here! Go on, boy, get Appa! (from o.c., as Momo tries to free himself, but fails) Appa is a ten ton flying bison, I think he could figure something out. Sokka! Katara! (Turning to guards) Where are my friends? And if I fail? I... guess it's fine. Really? I don't have time for your crazy games! Gimme my friends back! We're leaving! (to King Bumi) I'll do as you want. There, enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back, now! Okay, found him! Come here, Flopsy! Flopsy, wait! Flopsy! Flopsy! (to monster) Flopsy? Flopsy!  Guys, are you ok? (looking severe) Come on. I'm ready for the next challenge. (thinking) So, you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight? I... choose... you! (He is pointing at King Bumi.)  Can I fight the guy with the axe instead? Huh? That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests. How am I supposed to know his name? Yeh? Okay, so back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall. I saved his pet and I had a duel. Well, everything was different than I expected. Well, they weren't straightforward. To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. (Realization sweeping his features.) I know his name! I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities. (Cut King Bumi, who begins to laugh and snort, just as the younger version had in the flashback.) Bumi, you're a mad genius! (He runs and hugs the old King.)  Thank you for your wisdom. But before we leave, I have a challenge for you!"," Wow. We don't have cities like this in the South Pole. Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar. Technically, Aang is 112 years old. (now smiling serenely) Hi, June Pipinpadaloxicopolis. Nice to meet you. We will. This sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here, I'm starting to have second thoughts! Aang, do something! Use your airbending! (to Aang) Is it just me, or is this guy's crown a little crooked?  You can't keep us here. Let us leave. This is a prison cell? But it's so nice. We're not sticking around to find out. There's gotta be some way outta here. Well, no point in arguing about it now. (She gets in a bed.) Get some rest, Aang. Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow. Other than the crystal slowly encasing my entire body, doing great. Think about the challenges, maybe it's some kind of riddle. We're gonna keep trying, but that is a good backup. And what did you learn? (a piece of crystal growing into her cheek) And...? Uh, over here! So this crazy king is your old friend, Bumi?"," (in amazement) They have buildings here that don't melt! You need a disguise. Great! Now you look just like my grandfather. Great, so they get their mail on time. (chewing) Mmm! What? It was pretty funny. We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts. Nice or not, we're still prisoners. If you think we're gonna fit through there then you're crazier then that king. Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway? Ah! It's already creeping! Oh come on! I got it! He's an earthbender, right? Rocky! (Silence, followed by a cough in the background.) You know, because of all the rocks? Little help? Why did you do all this instead of just telling Aang who you were?",,,
6,Imprisoned,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=106," Great, you're back! What's for dinner? It's coming from over there! Let's go meet him! Nice to meet you! Hey, that guy's gotta be running somewhere, maybe we're near a village and I bet that village has a market! Great hat. I'll trade you some nuts for it. No she doesn't, we saw you earthbending. Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay. You must have really inspired him. What? ...and why would they do that? Sure, I got it. Yeh, yeh, just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this. Exactly! That's fun stuff. Katara, what's wrong? Maybe she's right. What do you say, Sokka? I wish I knew how to make a hurricane. (Cut to Katara and Sokka looking unhappy at this idea.) The Warden would run away and we'd steal his keys! I'm just tossing ideas around. (looking up and pointing o.c.) No, it's not. Look at the smoke. I bet they're burning coal – In other words, earth. Guys, throw me some coal!"," Seriously, what else ya got? An earthbender! Hello there, I'm Katara! What's your name? We just wanted to say “hi”. (excited) Which means no nuts for dinner! (Aang and Katara run o.c.)  Hey! Hey, you're that kid! Why did you run away before? But, Haru's an earthbender, he can help. How can you say that? Haru has a gift. Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are. I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already? I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father. thanks. He sounds like a great man. So, that's why you hide your earthbending? See this necklace? My mother gave it to me. I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her. No. (struggling) It's not working, we have to get help. Haru, there's a way you can help him. Please, there's no one around to see you, it's the only way. Haru, you did it! It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man. I guess so. Dawn? Can't we sleep in for once? (with a sly grin on her face) I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts. They took him! They took Haru away! The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation. It's all my fault, I forced him into earthbending. Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight. We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru. (determined) because they're going to arrest me for earthbending. Aang. Did you get all that? (also in a slightly exaggerated voice) How dare you call me “pipsqueak” you giant-eared cretin! A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things. (She puts her hands up to her ears and fans out her fingers in imitation of huge ears) Do herds of animals use them for shade? I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are! I'll show you who's boss – earthbending style! I said, “earthbending style!” (running and hugging him) Haru! It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you. It was the only way to find you. (bowing) It's an honor to meet you. (taking the bowl her hungry expression turns to disgust) Eruhh! (sitting down and eating a spoonful) Erahh! If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan? You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny? Sabotage? How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up. (standing up, grim determination on her face) We'll see about that. Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child of my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. (Cut to a view of the Warden watching from one of the catwalks above, Katara continues from o.c.) Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend, but they can't take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home. It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are, hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage, earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom! I can't. (close up, the lighthouse lamp playing directly behind her head) I'm not leaving. I'm not giving up on these people. We can't abandon these people. There has to be a way to help them. I tired talking the earthbenders into fighting back, but it didn't work. If there was just a way to help them help themselves. (touching the rig platform) But this entire place is made of metal. It's almost dawn, we're running out of time! Are you sure this is gonna work? Here's your chance, earthbenders! (She grabs a lump of coal and raises it high.) Take it! Your fate is in your own hands! (embarrassed) All it took was a little coal. So, I guess you're going home now? I can't. Your mission is to take back your home. Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole. I know. (She reaches for her necklace and starts in surprise when it is gone.) My mother's necklace! It's gone!"," We've got a few options. First, round nuts and some kind of oval shaped nuts, and some rock shaped nuts that... might just be rocks. Dig in! What was that!? Shouldn't we run away from huge booms – not toward them? He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously. Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! (Momo flies off-screen to join the others, Sokka looks downcast) Yeh, I hate'em too. Fire Nation! Act natural! Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here? Everyone should get some sleep. We're leaving at dawn. Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Good night. Good night. Slow down, Katara, when did this happen? (dropping her hand) Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone. I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines, all Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and – tada! Fake earthbending. Do you remember your cue? By “this” do you mean intentionally getting captured by an army of ruthless firebenders? Here they come! Get in your places! (in a slightly exaggerated voice) Get out of my way, pipsqueak! What did you call me? You better back off! (Placing his hand to partially block his mouth from the soldier's view) Seriously – back off. That's it – you're going down! No, you idiot! It's the girl! (in an exaggerated voice, his hands on Katara's shoulders) I'll hold her! (Then sotto voce) You've got 12 hours to find Haru, we'll be right behind you. Momo, you have some big ears! She'll be fine, Aang, Katara knows what she's doing. Your 12 hours are up, where's Haru? We've got to get out of here. We don't have much time, there are guards everywhere. Get on. What do you mean you're not leaving!? I say you're both crazy! (A searchlight comes close by and they hunker down until it passes.) Last chance, we need to leave – now! (shaking his head) I hate when you get like this. (Another search light comes close). Come on, we better hide. We don't have much time. What are we gonna do? Wouldn't he just take his keys with him? For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock... something they can bend. It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale.  There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo, and the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending, the coal only has one place to go – right back here. (drawing his boomerang) Stay back, I'm warning you!",,,
7,"The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)",http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=107," I'll try it! Yehhhh! Turns out clouds are made of water! Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen? Yes it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But, I don't know how to do my job. Yeh, a waterbending teacher, but there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me. I don't know. No. Ow! Hey, how was that cheering me up? (smiling) Thanks, Katara. (bows) Nice to meet you too. (Pause). So...is there something I can help you with? So, what do you want me to do exactly? (clearly lacking confidence) Right...that's me. Yeh, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the spirit world. (Exasperated) It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff! I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just... come to me. Hello? Spirit, can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm... here to try to help stuff. (shouting) The sun has set. Where are you, Hei-Bai? Well, spirit, uh, I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace!  Okay. Well, I guess that's settled then. You must be the Hei-Bai spirit. (He bows his head.) My name is... My name is Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help! Hey, wait up! Uh... Please, would you stop destroying things and listen?  I'm just trying to do my job as spirit bridge. Excuse me, would you please turn around? I command you to turn around now! Sokka, go back! I don't wanna fight him unless I – huh! Hang on, Sokka! Sokka! (He looks around and the view zooms out a bit.) I failed. Katara, Katara I lost him. What? No, I'm right here! Grrr!!! I'm in the spirit world! (smiling) I'll figure this out, Katara, I promise. Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem! Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here. But, I guess you can't see me either. What am I supposed to do? (shouting) Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you? Sokka? That's definitely not Sokka! What? I can't airbend in the spirit world! You don't know where Sokka is, do you? You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me. I need to save my friend and I don't know how. Is there some way for me to talk to Roku? I'll be back Katara. (To the dragon) Take me to Roku! Hey, what are you doing!? Ahhhh!!!  I don't understand. This is just a statue of Roku. Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him? It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice! (Turning to dragon) So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku? (The dragon grunts.) But I can't wait that long. I need to save Sokka now. (downcast) I'm not sure.  You're the spirit of this forest. Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned I was sad and upset. But my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back. Actually, I did have a little help. And there's something else.  I need to talk to Roku and I think I've found a way to contact his spirit. There's a temple on a crescent shaped island, and if I go there on the solstice I'll be able to speak with him. Yeh, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation."," (from o.c. at first) Those clouds look so soft, don't they? Like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft cottony heap. You're hilarious. Hey, what is that? Aang, are you ok? Shh! Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you. That's why we're going to the North Pole to find you a teacher.  Hey Aang, are you ready to be cheered up? These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back. Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back.  What happens then? Hey, ‘great bridge guy', can I talk to you over here for a second? Aang, you seem a little unsure about all this. So, can you help these people? I think you can do it, Aang. Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka. Sokka wait! Sokka! I know. (holding Sokka's boomerang and trying to sound hopeful) Everything's gonna be okay. It's ok, Appa. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat. It's no use, Appa. I don't see them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait. You're back! Where's Sokka? Aang, what are you doing? Run! Sokka! You were trapped in the Spirit world for 24 hours. How are you feeling? (angrily elbowing her brother) Sokka! I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do all on your own. That's great! But, the solstice is tomorrow."," Maybe you should give it a try. It's like a scar. Listen, it's so quiet. There's no life anywhere. Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for –  (whispering) What? I'm not allowed to be angry? The Avatar before you? He died over a hundred years ago, how are you supposed to talk to him? Hehe, cheered me up. Ow! Yeh, I probably deserved that. Hey, who are you? Why is it attacking you? Yehhh, we're all gonna get eaten by a spirit monster. This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up. He still shouldn't have to face this alone. It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him? That's it! He needs help! (He exits to his left.)  Hei-Bai! Over here! We'll fight him together, Aang. Aang, over here! Help! What happened? (looking pained) Like I seriously need to use the bathroom! You could give us some supplies and some money. What? We need stuff. What is it? Creepy, but great."," (yelling) Uncle! It's time to leave! Where are you? Uncle Iroh! Uncle? We need to move on, we're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him! (angry) My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go! Enough! We need to leave now! Get out of the water! On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes, but be back at the ship in half an hour or I'm leaving without you. Uncle! Uncle, where are you? Something's not right here. (He examines the hot tub, now with the stone projectiles embedded in it.) That pile of rocks... Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. My uncle's been captured by earthbenders! Yup, that's Uncle Iroh. The Avatar! You taught me well. Now would you please put on some clothes!",,

Look, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. (angrily) So get your big butt off the ground and let's go! But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means. I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the Solstice. That's today.  Thank you, for your... Come on, boy! We've got a long way to go! Faster!  I'm on it!  (holding his nose) Yeah, but there's just one little problem. If we fly north we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade. It's the only way. This is exactly why I didn't want you to come. Its too dangerous. Appa! Yip! Yip! Appa! Are you ok? We made it!!! There it is! The island Roku's dragon took me to! You did it buddy. Nice flying. Its almost sundown. We'd better hurry. Great! I am the Avatar. I'll hold them off. Run! Follow me! Nope! (Aang disappears around the corner. Sokka, Katara and Momo begin to follow him. Suddenly, Aang comes running back around the corner. A Fire Sage is hard on his heels.) Wrong way! (surprised and relaxing his poise) You do? How? Did you know Avatar Roku? Is that how you knew I was coming? If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the Sages attack me? (pausing and leaning against the tunnel wall) They were waiting for me. (bowing slightly to Shyu) Thank you for helping me. Shyu, what's wrong? Definitely. They're still locked. Why won't it open! Aargh! (hanging his head) I'm sorry I put you through all this for nothing. Wait, how is Sokka genius? His plan didn't even work. Did the definition of “genius” change in the last hundred years?  (standing up) The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening? Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me! Is it about that vision? The one with the comet? What does it mean? So the comet made them stronger? But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the war now?  But I haven't even started learning waterbending, not to mention earth and fire. What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail? But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?  I'm ready. Thanks. Where's Shyu?"," Please don't go, Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I. We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang. Aang, we got trouble. Fire ball! (covering her nose with her hand) We have to get out of Zuko's range before he shoots another hot stinker at us! There's no time. And that's exactly why we're here.(to Appa) Oh! You must be tired! (turns towards Sokka a wry look on her face) I was talking to Appa. The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died. That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there too!  Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door? You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka. (turning towards Aang) Its almost sunset. Are you ready? (grabbing Aang's arm) Aang, stop! There's nothing else we can do. Sokka! You're a genius! You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work...but it looks like it did. Aang! Now's your chance! Go! He made it! How's Aang going to make it out of this? No! Aang! Not without Aang! I don't know."," I think his big butt is trying to tell you something. At least not without your friends. We got your back. EWWWWW Yeah, and its gaining fast! Can't you make Appa go any faster? Let's run this blockade. (in pure disbelief) We got into the Fire Nation......(his shoulders slump)...Great... (thinking that Katara is talking to him) No. (grunting and stretching) I'm good. (jogging in place) Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders. (stopping in mid jog) Well, I was talking to Momo. I don't see any guards. Wait......I think I heard something. Do you know where you're going? Firebenders aren't our friends. (putting his arm around Aang's shoulders) Hey, don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late. Five fire blasts, huh? (Sokka's face lights up with an idea. The camera pans up to a lantern, in lieu of a light bulb, directly above his head. The “ding” of discovery sounds.) I think I can help you out. This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and tada! Fake firebending! I don't get it. That blast looked as strong as any firebending I've seen. Come on Aang, let her dream. How're we going to make it out of this? We got your back."," Having trouble sleeping? (Zuko pushes the Chief back into the doorway. Camera cuts to a close up of Zuko's face.) Seen the Avatar lately? I have no choice, Uncle. (turning around from the spy glass) I'm chasing the Avatar. My father will understand why I'm returning home. There they are! Helmsman, full steam ahead! On my mark.........Fire! A blockade! He's not turning around. (bowing his head) I'm sorry, Uncle. (Turning to his helmsman, he points forward) Run the blockade! (turning back towards the front of the ship) Do not stop this ship. We can make it! What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me? If Zhao wants to follow our trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do. Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail while I use it as a cover. The Avatar's coming with me! Close the doors! Quickly! Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut! Why did you help the Avatar? You're too late, Zhao. The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.",,
9,The Waterbending Scroll,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=109," It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives. (a frightened expression on his face) I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole! What am I gonna do!? You'd do that? Yehhh! Don't start without me, boy! Oh right, time to practice waterbending.  You could... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes? (smiling) Mud and bugs! (getting up and imitating Katara) Like this? Hey, I'm bending it already! Well, you had to figure it out on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher. So, what's next. Sorry. Well, don't stop now, keep'em coming! So, like this? Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else ya got? Uhhh... sorry. I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff. Uhh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle! Sure! What are curios? (defensively) Momo's not for sale. (to the Pirate Captain) Where did you get a waterbending scroll? I know how to deal with these guys, Katara, pirates love to haggle. (She gives him the 2 copper pieces). Watch and learn. Aang walks over the Pirate Captain.) What say to the price of... one copper piece! Okay – two copper pieces! (to the Pirate Captain) Aye, we be castin' off now! What was that all about, Katara. Well, well, look who's come to their senses. Told ya the haggling would pay off. No thanks! Hold on tight! Just hang on! I used to kinda look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible. No way. (smiling) Haha! Good one, Katara. Well, what's done is done. We have it. We might as well learn from it. (walking to the river) You'll get it. You just gotta shift your weight through the stances... (He gracefully manipulates the whip for a few seconds and then drops it back into the river.) There. See, the key to bending is... It's okay, Katara (yawning) What's wrong. No, Katara it isn't. (concerned) Yeh, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth... I'm over here, follow my voice! I'm right here! Uhh, never mind! I'll find you! Run! Katara! You're okay! A team of rhinos... or two waterbenders. Sokka! Can't you make it go any faster? Hey, you did the water whip! Oh, no! I knew a bison whistle would come in handy. Thanks, Appa. That's okay, Katara. Haha! Good one, Katara."," Calm down. It's going to be okay. If you want, I can try and teach you some of the stuff I know. We'll need to find a good source of water first. Remember the reason we're here. This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect, so don't be frustrated if you don't get it right away. Just push and pull the water like this...  The key is getting the wrist movement right. That's almost right, if you keep practicing, I'm sure eventually –  Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly. (Looking a little unhappy.) It took me two months to learn that move. Thanks. This is a more difficult move. I call it ""streaming the water."" It's harder than it looks so don't be disappointed if... Nice work, though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary. Well, I kinda know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave... (crossly) That's enough practicing for today. No offense, Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on. Look at this, Aang! It's a waterbending scroll. Check out these crazy moves! So, how much for the, uh, ""traded"" scroll? Aang, can we get out of here, I feel like we're getting weird looks. (hugging herself protectively) I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here. I...I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us! Aang, I thought we were running away from the pirates! (smiling) I know, that's why I took – this! Isn't it great? (self satisfied) I prefer to think of it as ""high-risk trading."" Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender. These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending. I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours.  ""The single water whip""... looks doable. What's so funny? (guiltily) Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip! (angry) Why can't I get this stupid move! (angry, shaking her fists in front of her) Will you PLEASE shut your air hole! Believe it or not, your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes. Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted! (She looks over at Sokka, who is not impressed.) What?  (now abashed) Omigosh, Aang, I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me. But, you know what, it won't happen again. (She rolls up the scroll and hands it to Aang.) Here, this is yours. I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore. (stroking his ears as he chitters) I'm sorry Momo. (angrily again) No more apologies! (whispering) Shh! Momo, go back to sleep. (frustrated) Shoot! Come on water, work with me here! Okay, Katara, shift your weight through the stances...(the stream collapses)...ugh! No, let go of me! Go jump in the river! My mother's necklace! How did you get that? No! Aang, this is all my fault. (smiling) Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples. Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get out of here! Everybody in! I couldn't have done it without your help! (pointing forward) Aang, look! We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water! It's working! It's slowing down! We're doing it! Aang, I still owe you an apology. (Cut to the three in the saddle, Katara kneeling and looking down at nothing.) You were just so good at waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all in danger. I'm sorry. Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway. The scroll! Stealing is wrong. (She takes the scroll.) Unless it's from pirates!"," Would you sit down? If we hit a bump you'll go flying off! What's bugging you anyway? Well, let's see, you've pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you 112 years... I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer. Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in. Nice puddle. Great. So what am I supposed to do? So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking the mud out of a giant bison's feet? (pausing for a second) Okay. Yeh, don't get too happy. You gotta do me next. Aang! Yeh, I'll say! (Cut to a shot of a bunch of bags floating down the river.) You just practiced our supplies down the river! (sinking back under the water) Ugh, it was hard enough when you were just an airbender. We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely. It doesn't even work. (Momo chitters into Aang's ear as his master stops blowing into it.) See, even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk. Waaait a minute...sea-loving traders...with suspiciously acquired merchandise...and pet reptile birds...You guys are pirates! Yeh, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection. (entering from right) No wonder they were trying to hack us up. You stole their waterbending scroll. It doesn't matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes! (turning and walking away) Whatever. I'm sorry, but you deserve that. (Screen expands to show Aang on the left. Sokka turns to him.) You've been duped. She's only interested in teaching herself. What about Momo? He's the real victim here. (clearly milking the situation) And... what about me? There was that time you –  Huh? Where did she go? (Cut to Sokka searching Aang's bag, Aang waking up in the foreground.) I don't believe it. She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing. It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep – Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap? You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment!? (appearing at the Captain's side) Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market then that fancy scroll. (looking sweetly at the obviously very interested pirates) I'm just sayin', it's bad business sense. Just imagine how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar. You guys would be set for life! Aang, are you there? (from o.c.) Where? I can't find you! We need a team of rhinos to budge this ship. I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the water tribe. Will you two quit congratulating each other and help me out! (tapping the side of his head) Have you lost your mind!? This is no time for flute practice! (pointing to the cutter) But we have another problem! Yeh, we owe ya one. Is that really how you feel? First, what did you learn?"," Someone's changing our course! What's the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course! Is it something to do with the Avatar? Lotus tile? (incensed) You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?  (turning to shout at his uncle) It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone! You bought a sumki horn? (walking over) This monk, did he have an arrow on his head? We don't need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right? Then they'll be on the water. I'll save you from the pirates. Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother. (trying to be reasonable) Try to understand, I need to capture to restore something I've lost. My honor. Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost. I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering. Tell me where he is. (producing the scroll and making fire in his hand beneath it) I wonder how much money this is worth? (The pirates gasp and some cry, ""no!""). A lot, apparently. Now you help me find what I want, you'll get this back and everyone goes home happy. Search the woods for the boy and meet back here. Nice work. Give me the boy. (pointing at Sokka) Don't listen to him! He's trying to turn us against each other. Shut your mouth, you water tribe peasant! You'll regret breaking a deal with me! We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle! Haha! Hey! That's my boat! (He runs o.c.)  (from o.c.) Come on, Uncle! My boat!",,
10,Jet,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=110," Where's Momo? Hang on Momo! All right—you too. That works... Why wouldn't we fly? (gently to Appa) Sokka's just jealous ‘cause he doesn't have an arrow. He's right. Who knows—walking might be fun. Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison? I'm tired of carrying this pack. That's a great idea! Hey, Sokka's Instincts, would you mind— Sokka, your shirt! Nice work, Sokka! How'd ya do that? (awed) You just took out a whole army almost single-handed! (to the Duke, chuckling) Pipsqueak—that's a funny name. It's hilarious. You guys have a hideout? I'll get up on my own. Nice place you got! Thanks Jet. Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me! Ow! Quit it! What? He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life—a really fun way of life. What can we do? Sorry Sokka. Really? (Aang and Katara stop and look at one another.) Sokka apologized? (back on the ground) What about me? Look, there's another steam vent. ...I bet that's enough—and I'm not just saying that to be lazy. I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout.  Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation. Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam. I've gotta stop him. (He runs for the edge.)  I need to get to the dam. I'm not gonna fight you, Jet. Sokka's still out there—he's our only chance. Sokka didn't make it in time. We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead? Um...Sokka? You know we're going the wrong way, right?"," What? What! Appa's not too noticeable! Who made you the boss? (incredulous) You're the leader? But your voice still cracks! If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean, he is the Avatar. Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl. Who? Gran-gran? I've met Gran-gran. Okay, we'll try it your way Oh Wise Leader. I don't know Aang. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts—they seem to know everything. You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's Instincts! (quietly) What are you doing? Look! Hi. Um...thanks for saving us Jet. We were lucky you were there. We were relying on instincts. Yes we wanna see it! It's beautiful up here! Why does the Fire Nation want to find you? That's so brave. Don't pay any attention to my brother. So, you all live here? What about you? Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation. Hey Jet, nice speech. Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. I could use some more training. (She blushes.)  Hey Sokka. Is Jet back? But I made him this hat. What? No, he's not. I wanna hear Jet's side of the story. No, he conveniently left that part out. I knew there was an explanation See Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife. We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest! You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader! Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet. Come on Aang. Jet—I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting.  Yeah, I did. I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes. ...I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know... When we're done we'll meet you over there. Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir. Well, we finished early--I'm sure he'll be happy to see us. ...What are they doing? Why would they need blasting jelly? What? No--that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that. (less convinced) Jet wouldn't do that. Jet—why? This isn't the answer! Where's Sokka? Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me—you're sick and I trusted you! What are you doing? (horrified) No! Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Please. (whisper) No... All those people...(She turns in rage back to Jet.) Jet—you monster! Sokka! Goodbye Jet. Lemme guess—your instincts told you."," This is gonna take forever. These are Fire Nation traps—you can tell from the metalwork. We'd better pack up camp, and get moving. Ah-ah...no flying this time. Think about it. Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa—he's just too noticeable. He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head—it's kinda hard to miss him! (to Aang OC) I know you all want to fly, but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk. I'm not the boss—I'm the leader. I'm the oldest and I'm a warrior. (tries to speak deeper) So...I'm the leader! Are you kidding—he's just a goofy kid! I-I've kissed a girl—you...just haven't met her. No—besides Gran-gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot and a leader has to trust his instincts. Ha ha. Very funny. Okay, okay—I get it. Look guys, I'm tired too. But the important thing is that-- (He pushes the branches from two rust red-leafed bushes and holds them, focussing his attention on Aang and Katara.) --we're safe from...the— (He finally turns around to see what's beyond the bushes.) --Fire...Nation... RUN! We're cut off! (Meanwhile, the left sleeve of his tunic is on fire.)  If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you. Bluffing? Uh...instinct?  Hey, he was mine! (frustrated) Man! Army? Pfft. There were only, like, twenty guys! Where...there's nothing here! Why...what's this do? Woah! (Sarcastically) Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a treehouse. Unfortunately we have to leave tonight. (He stands and walks away.)  What mission? Shh...it amplifies vibrations. Nothing yet. (Lowers his voice) Wait! Yes, someone's approaching. I think there's just one. (Low) Wait! False alarm...he's just an old man. Jet, he's just an old man! But he's not hurting anyone! This doesn't feel right. Yeah—he's back. But we're leaving. Your boyfriend Jet's a thug. He's messed up Katara. He beat and robbed a harmless old man! Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian I didn't see any knife! There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things. (He leaves.)  I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him. Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct— I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town. There are people living there Jet—mothers and fathers and children. You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire! I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want. You can't do this! How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town? If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn. While you two are up there you might want to practice your knot-work. (He holds up his now-worthless bindings, then turns and walks away.)  It will be safe—without you. I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time. At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy. But one man vouched for me—the old man you attacked. He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time. Who would be free—everyone would be dead. No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people. Yip yip. Hey—sometimes they're right. ...And sometimes they're wrong. (With a grin, he pulls Appa's reigns. They fly off screen, then reappear going in the opposite direction. FADE OUT.) ",,,
11,The Great Divide,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=111," Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the... (Katara and Sokka turn away from each instantly, their arms across their chests, expressions of sullen anger on their faces) Hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent? (laughs, and spreads his arms wide in a gesture of conciliation) Okay, listen guys. Harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs? (smiling in a self satisfied manner) You see that? Settling feuds and making peace. All in a days work for the Avatar. Come on Momo, that's fair. (Motioning to Appa) Appa's got FIVE stomachs. Here it is, guys, the Great Divide. (looking to the ground in doubt) I... don't know. A fight over chores is one thing. These people have been feuding for 100 years. Uh...you could share the earthbender and travel together? (Angry) Alright! Here's the deal! (Cut to a slowly panning wide shot) We're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across. Does that seem fair? Sorry Appa. You'll have to do this on your own. (Appa grunts.)  To tell the truth, I'm not sure. (Smiling widely) But when have I ever been? Appas's gonna take good care of you until we get there. (He drops down to the ground and addresses Appa) See ya on the other side, buddy. Yip, yip! Nice bending! Why'd you do that? What was that? ...we're trapped in this canyon. Look. Sticking together is the only way to... (turning to look back o.c. at Katara and the Guide) Any ideas? ENOUGH! (Cut to Aang, angry) I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not going to happen.  We should split up. Gan Jins on this side...and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines. Sokka, you go with the Zhangs. And Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can figure out why they hate each other so much. Sure would be nice to be around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing. (Momo chitters as the screen cuts to a frontal shot of Aang and his lemur.) It's okay, Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough and then we can eat our weight in leechy nuts! Nah, I'll wait for the leechy nuts. I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here. Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon? What are you talking about? Okay! Okay! I get it! Now I need your help. Let's get everyone together at the base of the canyon wall. Please everyone! As soon as we get out of here we can eat, and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff. Guys! FOCUS! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, ACTION will! (nervously) You know, I take it back! Harsh words aren't so bad! Is that... food? (In disbelief) Everyone smuggled food down here!? (Turning back to the Zhang) UNBELIEVABLE! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day!? You are all...AWFUL! So hungry... (he points at the pie, desperately trying to retain self control) is that...egg custard in that tart? (shouting) Everybody! Watch me! (He raises a food bag to show everybody) Do what I do! (shouting) Now, follow me! We're riding out of this hole! Everyone! Get off! Wait a second! Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys! No! (the leaders lower their weapons and turn to Aang) I mean I really knew them. I may not look it, but I'm 112 years old. I was there a hundred years ago on the day you're talking about... There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies, they were brothers (the two stop fighting and look at each other in shock), twins in fact (they change instantly with a popping sound to look alike except for their clothes) and they were eight (the scene splits to reveal very young, chibi versions of the two characters, music box like music begins to play in the background) and most importantly, they were just playing a game! (The two kids smile and open their mouths in laughter). The sacred orb from the legend (a balls drops between the two kids) ...that was the ball. And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts (screen widens to show a playing field with two gate-like goal posts). Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Win Jei didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it back toward the other goal. But he stepped out of bounds (a referee in the shape of a panda appears, waving a red flag and blowing a whistle), so the official put him in the penalty box, not for twenty long years, but for two short minutes.  There was no stealing and no putting anyone in prison. Just a game.  Nope, just a regular ball. That's what the game was called, Redemption. As soon as someone got the ball from one goal to the other everyone would yell, ""redemption!"" (The leaders look at each other) Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true, but they respected each others differences enough to share the same playing field. Good to see ya, boy! Did you miss me? (turning to him, drenched in Appa's saliva) Well, you know, I try. (smiling) You could call it luck. (Grinning evilly) Or, you could call it... lying! (sheepishly) I made the whole thing up. (looking around) Now where's that custard tart? (Cut to wide shot of them moving to get on Appa) I'm starving!"," Um...aren't you forgetting the TARP? (crossly) Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on TOP of the tent. You know, so we don't get RAINED on. But what if it DOES rain? (stomping the ground and gritting her teeth) Ur...arg! You're infuriating! (looking sullen, then exploding in anger) Well if you don't like my firewood... (throws the wood at her brother) have it! (whipping around to yell at her brother's back) Oh yeah? (Pointing an accusatory finger) Well you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the (she bends down quickly, picks up a twig, and throws it at her brother) ...Tents! (concurrent with Sokka) Sounds good. Wow! I could just stare at it forever. How can you not be fascinated, Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world. (clasping her hands in front of her in a gesture of hope) Ooooo...canyon guide. Sounds informative. You're a refugee. Is that your tribe? Um... (pointing to her right, o.c.) one of them I think. (As Gan Jin Leader speaks) Well Aang, ready to put your peace making skills to the test? (walking forward and raising her voice to be heard by all) Everyone, listen up! (Pointing backward at Aang, a fierce look on her face) This is the Avatar! And if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy. (Putting a hand on Aang's shoulder) He's the Avatar, Sokka. Making peace between people is his job. Your arms...they're broken. You really think it'll rain? So it was you guys who had food! (hesitating, then taking the bread) Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it. (She eats a few bites, then turns back to the Gan Jin Leader) So, why does your tribe hate the Zhang so much? (somewhat harshly) I don't think so, Aang, the Zhang's really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin We and stole the sacred orb. (arms across her chest) Not punished enough if you ask me! Oh no! That's a lot of canyon crawlers! Sokka, wait! I don't care about this stupid feud! I just want us to get out of here alive. (in disbelief) You did not! (Then in devilish admiration) That is so wrong."," Right...got it. Ordinarily you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides, that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket. (spreading his arms wide in exasperation) But what if it doesn't? Then I would have put the tarp up for nothing. Katara, why don't you worry about gathering the firewood because that kindling's looking PRETTY sorry. Fine by me! If you're not going to do your job (he yanks the rope securing the tent to its to one of its supports. It falls down in a heap) ...urg! (still facing o.c.) Why don't you ask Miss Know It All? Queen of the Twigs! (concurrent with Katara) Whatever. (unimpressed, the music slurs to a halt in the background) Okay. I've seen enough. Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away. Calm down, we know you're next. This feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this? (slumping in despair) His job's gonna make us cross this whole thing on foot, isn't it? We gotta help him! Okay...now you gotta help me! (camera zooms in on him) I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like... canyon crawlers... So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps? (releasing suppressed exasperation) Exactly! Finally, someone gets it. Would I!? (munching, barely paying attention) Mm hmm! (still munching) Mmmm! That's just terrible. (Pointing to her leg of meat) You gonna finish that? Yeh, Katara, what are you talking about? We Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin. (drawing out his boomerang) We barely survived one! (looking chagrined) Me too. I only took their side because they fed me. That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin. What!?",,,
12,The Storm,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=112," I need you too. Be careful guys! Guys? Gyatso? I didn't mean to. It's nothing, I just had a bad dream. Go back to sleep. I'm okay. I think I just need some rest. Look at those clear skies, buddy! Should be some smooth flying. I think it's true, Katara, swishing means it's ripe. (to Katara and Sokka) Maybe we should find some shelter? Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky. I'm sorry for running away. Actually, he wasn't. I don't wanna talk about it. Well, it's kind of a long story. I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar. I was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter... First, you form a ball. Then you gotta get on quick. Quick, get on! (dismounting his own scooter) You kinda have to balance on it like it's a top. (He twirls his finger to demonstrate.)  I made it up. How do you know it's me? Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little! (He picks up the propeller toy.)  I just chose them because they seemed fun.  Well, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew is that after I found out, everything began changing... Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing! Great! (dismayed) What's going on? (trying to smile) But I'm still the same – nothing's changed. So, what, I can't play? (dismounting his scooter) Oh, ok. What do you mean? (pointing at the board) Hey! Then, just when I was starting to feel better, something worse happened. How could they do that to me! They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved! (his glow fading) I'm sorry I got so mad.  Well, that's not exactly what happened... (from o.c., narrating from the present) I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do. I never saw Gyatso again. Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg. (looking up at Katara) And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help. The world needed me and I wasn't there to help. The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world. You don't know that.  (standing, resolute) I'm going to find them. (to the old woman) We'll be back soon, I promise. Come on, Appa! (pointing to the horizon) The boat! It's there! Hang on to the rope! He doesn't have to apologize. Actually, I don't eat meat. Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past.  I can't make guesses about how things would have turned out if I hadn't run away. I'm here now and I'm going to make the most of it."," We need you, Aang. Are you all right, Aang? You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately, you wanna tell me about it? (examining empty food bag) Well, we better smoothly fly ourselves to a market, cause we're out of food. What happened in your dream? I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing. (putting fruit back) I just realized we're out of money anyway. You could get a job, smart guy. (smiling, hands on hips) That's right. (coming to Aang's side, angry) Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone! Aang is the bravest person I know! He has done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him. It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? Aang? What's wrong? You're a horrible old man! (mounting Appa) Appa, yip! Yip! It's ok. That fisherman was way out of line. What do you mean? It has to do with your dream, doesn't it? Talk to me. I'm gonna try to get a little fire going. So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it? That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say. Whoa! Hot cinders! You have a right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that. You ran away. You don't know what would've – Aang... You're being too hard on yourself. Even if you did run away, I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders. I know it's meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope. (rushing to her side) It's ok, you're safe. What do you mean? Where's Sokka? I'm going with you. Where are they? (smiling) I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore."," (groggily) Huh? Uh... what's going on? Did we get captured again? Don't have to tell me twice. (sits up, excited) You guys want to hear about my dream? (Silence, as Katara looks annoyed.) That's ok, I didn't wanna talk about it anyway. (alarmed) Guys, wait, this was in my dream, we shouldn't go to the market. Food eats people!  Also, Momo could talk. (To Momo.) You said some very unkind things. (depressed) Out of food and out of money, now what are we supposed to do? Are you kidding? Shelter from what? (running up to them) I'll go! (to his friends) What? You said ‘get a job' and he's paying double. I said I was gonna do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather. Hey, they left without saying goodbye! I know! This one time I was... I'm too young to die! (holding out his hand) Seriously, you're still gonna pay me, right? Do you hear that? It's stopped raining."," (lowering the telescope) You're out of your mind, Uncle. The weather's perfect. There is not a cloud in sight. We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same. The safety of the crew doesn't matter!  Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.  (crossing to the Lieutenant) Lieutenant, you'd better learn some respect, (pointing at his chest with two fingers) or I will teach it to you. (to Iroh) I don't need your help keeping order on my ship. (in a higher voice than we are used to) Let me in! (Iroh appears from the left, putting his hands on the young man's shoulders.)  I want to go into the war chamber, but the guard won't let me pass!  If I'm gonna rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can? (bowing to Iroh) Thank you uncle! (jumping up) You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them? Please, father, I only had the fire nation's best interest at heart! I'm sorry I spoke out of turn! (stricken, abasing himself on the floor) I meant you no disrespect. I am your loyal son. I won't fight you. Where were we hit? The helmsman! The Avatar! (pausing to consider) Let him go. We need to get this ship to safety. Uncle, I am sorry.",,
13,The Blue Spirit,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=113," (walking over) How's Sokka doing? I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea, but I found a map. There's an herbalist institute on the top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for Sokka there. Not you too! That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him – he thinks he's an earthbender! A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense too. (Getting up and grabbing his staff.) I'm going to find some medicine. Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot. (Cut back to Appa et al, Aang continues from o.c.) Keep an eye on'em guys. (speaking very fast) Hello! I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I need some medicine for my friends. They have fevers and they've been coughing and – That's nice. That's nice. Are you almost done? Finally! Thanks for all your help! (looking frightened and abashed) Taking the cure to my friends! What about my friends? What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs? (shocked) Suck on them!? You're insane aren't you? Uhh, I think you dropped this. A frog! I've never hidden from you. Untie me and I'll fight you right now! What? No! Don't leave frogs! My friends are sick and they need you! Please go back to being frozen! Who are you? What's going on? Are you here to rescue me? (The Blue Spirit opens the door and motions for him to follow.) I'll take that as a ""yes."" My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out! (The Blue Spirit comes back, picks him up by the collar and carries him out. He continues from o.c.) Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs! Stay close to me! Here, take this. Jump on my back! Gimme the next one! (from o.c. at first) You know what the worst part about being born over a hundred years ago is? I miss all the friends I used to hang out with. Before the war started (cut to Aang still looking down at the ground), I used to always my friend Kuzon. The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He was one of the best friends I ever had (he turns to face Zuko) – and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you. (Cut back to Zuko still looking at Aang.) If we knew each other back then (cut back to Aang), do you think we could have been friends too? Suck on these. They'll make you feel better. No, I don't think I did."," This should bring your fever down. That's nice. I'll tell him. Not so good. Being out in that storm really did a number on him.  Aang, he's in no condition to travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow. Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fine – Listen carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river and fill it with water. Got it? Momo should be back any minute. Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter! (Momo's ear go straight u. He then jumps off her and scampers o.c.) Aang, what in the world is taking you so long? (with a weak, sickly voice) How many times do I have to tell you, Momo, we need water. Wa-ter. Oh forget it. Aang, please, hurry."," (feverishly) You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor. Haha! Classic Appa. (swinging at something that isn't there) Take that, you rock! (deliriously) Haha! You guys are killin' me! Katara... please... water... Water... (delirious) Who's this ""Aang"" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness? (speech impaired by the amphibian oral obstruction) Aang, how was your trip? Did you make any new friends? Mmmm! This is tasty! Mmm!"," What do they want? (sullenly) I've got nothing to report to Zhao. Now get off my ship and let us pass. (angrily) Off my ship! I don't care what they do. (Looks away out to sea.)  (turning back, desperation and fear on his face) How, Uncle? With Zhao's resources it's just a matter of time before he captures the Avatar. (Turns back out to sea and whispers) My honor, my throne, my country, I'm about to lose them all. (walking away) I'm going to bed. No disturbances.",,
14,The Fortuneteller,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=114," Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka. (Holds up a necklace.)  Not tangled – woven. (Airbending himself to a standing position and turning to Katara.) I made you a necklace, Katara. (Looking from side to side in an embarrassed fashion) I thought since you lost your other one... I don't see why I can't do both. (Katara puts necklace on in the background.)  You mean all of you or just your neck? I mean, uh, both look great. (rubbing his head in an embarrassed gesture) I...well... (clearly put down) Thanks. Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear! Make noise, it'll run off! And then run in zigzags! Whoa there! Aunt who? What do ya know, an umbrella! Not everyone has the gift, Sokka. (rubbing his nose) Hello. Aang. (confused) I... guess... Likewise. (earnestly) Good luck with that! (pushing puffs away) I'm good on puffs. So...what do you think they're talking about back there? (growing more alarmed at each of Sokka's pronouncements) Yeh... dumb stuff like that... (bites his fingernails, eyes wide) well, I've gotta find a bathroom! Yeh, when I was in there... Wow, that's a big crack. (The bone cracks again, almost disintegrating.)  (dramatic music and the sound of fire suddenly dies away) Yeh, yeh, I knew that already, but did it say anything about a girl? Yes! Really!? (He stands and clasps his hands in a gesture of thanks) Thank you, Aunt Wu!  (knowingly) They sure are. (smiling) Some stuff. You'll find out. (pointing up) That cloud looks like a fluffy bunny. Sure, I guess. (Camera pans left as Aang simultaneously pushes her off the screen.) Hey Katara, don't you think that cloud looks like a flower? Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal.  Never mind. They seem happy, Sokka. So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right? Well, there's this girl...(cut to shot of Aang in the foreground, with Meng hiding behind a barrel at the far end of the square, stalking Aang. She laughs.)  You do? And you're ok with it? She does!? Well, how do I do that? (to a sound effect) You can be too nice? (screen pans left to show Meng sidling up to Aang) Well...ok. See ya later. Oh, hey Katara. I didn't see you there. (shouting after her) That's ok, I'm busy with my own stuff. (trying to sound cool) So...papaya. You know me. (He picks up a fruit.) I don't really care what I eat. Maybe aloof isn't my style. (to Momo, perched on his shoulder) Did you see that? Excuse me. Where can a guy find one of those things? Not just any flower – a panda lilly. I've seen it in action and boy does it work. But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and Aunt Wu said if I trusted my heart I would be with the one I love. Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about love? (Pointing up.) There, on the rim! Oh no! Aunt Wu was wrong. There's no time to walk. (He opens up his glider.) Grab on. (He grabs Sokka and they launch into the air.)  Hi, Katara. But, she doesn't even charge. Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here. You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction. You have to take fate into your own hands. But they will listen to Aunt Wu. Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own ha(who has just emerged from the lake, holding a fish as if about to give it a kiss) Oh look! nds. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book. (whispering) Shh... we don't want anyone to hear us. Oh! I didn't see you there. Of course I like you. Oh. I guess not. (sadly) I know what you mean. (he blushes) Huh? Don't worry. You're gonna meet a great guy who's gonna completely fall for you. I know it. (He puts his hands on her shoulders.)  How did you know? (blushing) Oh, thanks. I guess. Clouds are made of water and air so between the two of us we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want. We can still save the village if we act fast. Sokka has a plan. If any of you are earthebenders come with me. Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe! (sheepishly looking at the ground) By the way, we kind of borrowed your book. Can I ask you something? You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you? You just told me what I wanted to hear."," Look! (smiles, walks over to Aang and takes necklace) Thanks, Aang. I love it. (from o.c.) So, how do I look? (looking in annoyance o.c. towards her brother) Stop teasing him, Sokka. (Momo hops up onto Aang's shoulder.) Aang's just a good friend. (She rubs Aang's head) A sweet little guy – just like Momo. (She rubs Momo's head just as she had Aang's a moment before.)  Run down hill, then climb a tree! Wow, it must be. That explains why you were so calm. Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun. That proves it. (She runs under the umbrella with Aang.)  I guess you're not really getting wet then. Just admit you might be wrong and you can come under the umbrella. Really? Try to keep an open mind, Sokka. There are things in this world that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future? I guess that's me. Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I could get you some if you want. (Aang sticks his tongue out, his face clearly expressing his disdain for discussions around moisturizer) So, do you see anything interesting in my love line? (Aang's eyes bug out instantly and he leans in close to hear.)  Tell me more! You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life. (cut to Katara and Aang) Well, I liked my predictions. Certain things are going to turn out very well. (She holds her hands together in a gesture of hope.)  Why, what did she tell you? (also looking up) What's with the sky? (putting a hand on Sokka's shoulder) Shhhh!! She's coming!  Shh!! Hi, Aunt Wu. Sorry to bother you. About this man I'm supposed to marry (her cheeks flush momentarily in embarrassment)...is he gonna be handsome? (She clasps her hands together in a gesture of hope.) Oh, I hope he's tall! Yes, please! Wow, thanks Aunt Wu. (Gets up, turns to leave, but turns back.) Oh, wait, one more thing. How warmly should I dress tomorrow? Okay, okay, but, one more thing. Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow? Ohhh, I hate papaya. (walking away) Hey Aang. Ugh. Papaya please. Uh-huh. Would you like some? Ok then. See you later. Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her? I know, but still. Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going to take an awful lot to change my min – Oh, no! If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes. They just won't listen to reason. (Aang flies back down to them.)  (reading Aunt Wu's book) I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom. It's too much! It's gonna overflow! Wait, what did you just say? I suppose he is... (taking Sokka by the shoulders) It's ok, Sokka. Everything's gonna be all right. Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! Take care, Meng."," He is taunting us. (Cut to long shot of the group.) You are so gonna be dinner! (Sokka runs back to the tent and grabs his fishing pole which standing up outside of it, runs back to the lake edge and casts the pole a few times without effect.) Hey! Where's the fishing line? Aahh, it's all tangled! (again at the water's edge and looking back at Aang) Great, Aang. Maybe instead of saving the world you can go into the jewelry making business. Stop taunting me!  (who has just emerged from the lake, holding a fish as if about to give it a kiss) Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love. (The fish flips is his hands, knocking him back into the lake.)  No, play dead, he'll lose interest! No, punch him in the bill! Mmm! Lunch! (He sniffs egg, then looks at calm man o.c. with a haughty look.) Lucky for you we came along. But the fortuneteller was wrong! You didn't have a safe journey, you were almost killed! Oh come on, fortunetelling is nonsense. (holding the egg above his head to try and deflect the rain) No it doesn't – you can't really tell the future. Of course she predicted it was gonna rain. The sky's been gray all day. Look, I'm going to predict the future now (making funny motions and in an exaggerated voice) – “It's going to keep drizzling.” (He folds his arms across his chest and assumes an expression of defiance.) See! (as he gets soaked) Yahhh! I'll try a curd puff. Oh, don't be modest. They're huge!  I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense. It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.  Not bad. Not bad. Mmmm! (Offers puffs to Aang.)  Boring stuff, I'm sure. Love. Who she's going to marry. How many babies she's gonna have. Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break. I don't even wanna know! (standing) Okay, let's get this over with. But, you didn't read my palms or anything! Well, now you got to see for yourselves that fortunetelling is just a big, stupid hoax. (exploding) That woman is crazy! My life will be calm, and happy and joyful! Ow! (From o.c.) That doesn't prove anything! Do you even hear yourself?  (incensed) I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy old woman's superstition. I can't believe all these saps. (Cut to side view where it is apparent that Aang follows behind him.) Someone really needs to scream some sense at them. Not for long. I'm gonna prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense. (Turns and grabs nearby man.) Hey, you. I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she? Uh-huh. And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune? (swirling red fire appears behind him, demonstrating his anger and frustration) THEN OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO COME TRUE! I don't care what Aunt Wu told you, you have to take a bath sometime! (smugly) Some stuff? You've come to the right place. (Puts his arm around Aang's shoulders and points at his chest in a conspiratorial gesture.) What can I do you for? I think I know who you mean. (clearly thinking of Meng rather than Katara) Of course I am. And, to tell you the truth, I've been picking up the subtle vibe that she likes you too. (Meng visible in the background, waving her arms trying to get Aang's attention.)  Oh yeh, she's crazy about ya. All ya have to do now is not mess it up. The number one mistake nice guys like you make being too nice. Yup. If you want to keep her interested you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other. (rubbing his chin in admiration) Wow, that kid is good. (from o.c.) I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower. (climbing into frame from below) Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness. What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff too. Those people all think they're safe. We've got to warn'em. Aaahhh! Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano. Everyone! That volcano is gonna blow any second. Aunt Wu was wrong! (another explosion occurs) Look! (Pointing to the mountain.) Can your fortunetelling explain that? (annoyed) Yes! Yes, it can! I know, that's the problem. Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds. Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river. Everybody else grab a shovel (explosion sounds)... come on, we've gotta hurry! Dig faster! Dig faster! Man, sometimes I forget what powerful bender (Katara's expression instantly changes at this, remembering Aunt Wu's words) that kid is. Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender. No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortunetelling. (getting right in the Calm Man's face) I hate you.",,,

Hey, I ride animals too! One time there was this giant eel – What's that story? I can't believe they would leave me. Uh, I know Bato. It's the map to Sokka and Katara's Dad! Hey everyone! Sorry I was gone so long.(with exaggerated happiness) Yup, but now I'm back. Sure...could go for some delicious sea prunes! (taking the map back) I'm sorry! I'll take care of this.  What's ice-dodging?(Looking nervous and guilty) I know that! Why wouldn't I know that? I'm the Avatar! I know about trust. What does that even mean!? I can't.(rubbing off the mark) No, you can't trust me. (holding out the crumpled scroll) A messenger gave this to me for Bato. (Katara looks at the scroll and draws in a breath of surprise.) You have to understand, I was afraid you'd –  Okay. You too. Guess I should be moving on. I'm an idiot, Momo. Looks like we're going alone, guys. Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone.(in alarm) Who? Zuko! A necklace? (Eyes suddenly going wide) Huh! Katara! You've got something I want!  So, where do we go? Don't you want to see your father? I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you – Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like...this!(smiling) Zuko asked to be sure I got it to you. Sure!"," (entering wider shot) Did someone lose something? (pointing o.c. to the right) Wait! Look! Is this... Dad's boat? Bato! Is he here? Bato! It looks like home! No way! Stewed sea prunes? Bato, is it true you and Dad lassoed an arctic hippo? Everyone does. You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures. Really? I do really miss him. It would be great to see Dad. Even if we had time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel. We don't have time for a long detour. Hey Aang, I didn't notice you left. He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough. There's no way through! Of course you can! Aang, what are you talking about.(looking at Aang, then lowering her eyes) I'm with you, Sokka. Good luck. That wolf sounds so sad. Sokka?(smiling) You're right. Aang! We're getting you to the North Pole. And we need you. I'll be okay.(grabbing the necklace and putting it on happily) Aang, how did you get that? (in mock appreciation) Oh, that's so sweet of Zuko. Would you give him a kiss for me when you see him?","(grabbing it) Lemme see that. This is a water tribe weapon. (To Aang, behind him over he left shoulder.) See if you can find anything else. It's burned.  There was a battle. Water tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders.  The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill... I don't know. The trail ends here.

Please, Dad! (eyes watering) I don't understand. Who's there? Bato?  Where's Dad? (cutting Aang off) What smells so good, Bato? (He sniffs the air.) Perfume? Maybe we could dump some on Appa? Because he stinks so much! Am I right? Everything's here, even the pelts! Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things. (cutting Aang off) So who was it that came up with the great blubber fiasco? It's a long one, Aang, some other time. Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran-Gran you were a water spirit? When? It's been over two years since we've seen Dad! That would be so incredible. Katara?(less exuberantly) It would be great, but we can't. We have to take Aang to the North Pole first. Is this the boat he took you ice-dodging in? How are we supposed to ice-dodge without ice? Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady! Aang, less sail! (Sokka, sweating, pulls the tiller to his right) Katara, give him room! Aang! Helm to lee! Helm to lee! Great job! We can make it! Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail! (Aang nods.) Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks! (Cut to zooming close up of Sokka's determined face.) Now!(looking at the map, and then Aang in hurt and surprise) This is the map to our father! You had it the whole time!? How could you? (Aang shrivels up.) Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own! I'm going to find Dad. Katara, are you with me? It's probably wounded.(after a pause) We need to go back. I want to see Dad, but helping Aang is where we're needed the most. Thanks, Bato.(defiantly) We split up! He's long gone. Pretty stupid. (Grabbing Katara by the arm) Run! I'm starting to get some feeling back! (A bunch of tiles fall on them) Ow! That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at. Yeh, we've lost too much time as it is. Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family too, and right now, you need us more."," There are no stowaways on my ship. He's paralyzed. But how did you find him on my ship? Out of my way! Step aside, filth! I need to talk to you. Your beast trashed my ship. You have to pay me back. (grabbing her hand as she raises her cup to her lips) Money isn't what I had in mind.(from o.c.) I need you to find someone. It's not the girl I'm after, it's the bald monk she's traveling with. If you find them, I'll consider the damage to my ship paid for. We're looking for someone. Why are we stopping?(grabbing the necklace from June's hand) We have no time for this! Hey, watch it! Where is he? Where's the Avatar? How stupid do you think I am? What are we supposed to do now? What's it doing? It's just going around in a circle! Uncle? I didn't see you get hit with the tongue.",,
16,The Deserter,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=116," I bet we'll find something to eat here! (Cut to a frontal shot of the flyer). The Fire Days Festival. (Reading the flyer.) Fire Nation cultural exhibits...jugglers, benders, magicians. This'd be a great place for me to study some real firebenders! Hey, a poster of me! I have to learn firebending at some point, and this could be my only chance to watch a master up close. You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival. Ready disguises! Let's go. (pointing ahead, o.c.) Hey, there's some food.(looking o.c. to his right) Hey, look at this. I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good. I gotta learn that trick! (raising his hand and waving it about) Oh! Oh! Me! Me! I want to get a closer look. Awww! That could'a been me. We gotta help her! I'm calling Appa! Appa! Down here! Nice touch setting off the fireworks. You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord? (Standing up) We've gotta go see him! He can train me! (hurt) Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me. Is that where Jeong Jeong is? I need to talk to him right away. What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now? Why won't he see me? Wait, how does he know that? I'm going in anyway! Master, I need to learn firebending.(sitting down) I'm the Avatar. It's my destiny to...  Ookay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines. Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance. Really? That's great! (as Jeong Jeong begins to walk away) Wait! What do I do now? But what am I concentrating on? (looking at the sun then turning back to Jeong Jeong, a large smile on his face) So when do I get to make some fire? Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts? (clearly disappointed and impatient) What? You brought me up here to breathe? You're not even look...  I've been breathing for hours. (angrily throwing his hands wide in a gesture of frustration) I want you to stop wasting my time! I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun. (Here he makes semi-disrespectful gestures mimicking each of the activities that Jeong Jeong has insisted he practice.) I want to know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips! I thought about what you said. I promise I'll be more patient. Oh yeh! I mean, let us begin. What's going on? (petulantly) This is the worst firebending instruction ever. All he does is leave me alone for hours to concentrate or breathe. But I'm ready to do so much more. I did it! I made fire! Now that's firebending! (continuing to play) Wonder how that juggler did it? Katara! (He hops over to her as she cries pitifully) I'm so sorry!  Iiiit was an accident! I was... Katara, I'm so - I'm sorry, I didn't... (Sokka walks away) I'm sorry! Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again. No, never again. What? How? (airbending himself to his feet) Where? (running out of the hut) I have to help him! (from o.c. ) Jeong Jeong! YOU were Jeong Jeong's student? Whoa! Wild shot! (to himself) No self control... Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up. Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days! Ahoy! (Sticking his butt out at the admiral and wiggling it suggestively) I'm Admiral Zhao! I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko. Sloppy. Very sloppy. You've lost this battle. (motioning to his left) No, but you have. Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint. Have a nice walk home! Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong? Wow! That's good water. Two?"," This should give us a good idea of what's around here. I think we better keep moving. (looking at the ground, unsure) I guess we could check it out.  We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave. I think we need some new disguises.(Crossing her arms) ""Flaming fire flakes"" hot? What do you know. Aang, hold on! Where are we going? It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves. (backing away and shaking her head) Uh (standing up as well) It can't hurt just to talk to him. I'm sure there's a good reason. (coming closer) Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow. Careful! Aang, you'll hurt yourself! But you're a great master. You have powers I'll never know. I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang? You'll have to eventually. It's okay, Aang. I'm healed. I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking! By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong. Aang, you're burned. Let me help you. (shrugging) I guess I always knew. He tried to get the first fish hook out with another fish hook."," (finishing with the empty bag) See if you can find a menu, I'm starving. (from other side of the board) You might wanna rethink that. Look at this. A wanted poster. This is bad. What!? You want to walk into a Fire Nation town where they're all fired up with all their, you know, fire? (to no one) Yeh, because we always leave before we get into trouble. (sarcastically) It's like you're a whole different person. (skeptical and annoyed) Where are we gonna get masks like that? (as Aang and Katara rush over) That was surprisingly easy. (running ahead) Finally! (To food merchant) What do you have? I'll take'em! Aaahhh! Hot! Hot! Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution. What do you think you're doing? No, we don't want to make a scene! I think it's time to go. I hope he can really hear that bison whistle! You seem to really know your explosives. (surprised) You're a Fire Nation soldier! He was very highly ranked, we get it. We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender! (standing up) Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the north pole in the morning. That's what you said about going to the festival! Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me!? Hold on, you know these guys!? (getting up on his elbows) Finally! Let's hit the road. (He stretches back out again.)  (from afar) Hey! (rushing into the frame) Katara, what's wrong!? (To Aang, angrily) What did you do? I told you we shouldn't mess around with this! Look what you did! You burned my sister! You burned my sister! (Shot widens more to show Jeong Jeong has returned. Then, to Jeong Jeong) This is all your fault! Katara! Are you all right? (from o.c.  Aang, come on! He disappeared. They all did. When did you learn how to do that? Oh... well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the grease briar bramble and that time I had two fish hooks in my thumb! Oh, and the time that big snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful.",,,
17,The Northern Air Temple,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=117," Aren't airbender stories the best? I laugh at gravity all the time. Haha! Gravity.  Hey thanks for the story! (Momo climbing back up to his shoulder) It means a lot to hear airbender stories. It must have been hundred years ago your great grandpa met them. Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple! This is where they had the championships for sky bison polo. Hey guys, look at this! (leaning back and folding his arms unhappily) No, they're not. (from o.c. as the camera returns to a shot of the temple and its gliders) Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move. They're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.  Yeh, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding! (clearly not enthused) It's great. (looking embarrassed but happy) Thanks. This place is unbelievable. No, just unbelievable. (sadly from o.c. as the camera pans the mural) This is supposed to be the history of my people. (as the smoke erupts from the statue) Ugh! It's nice to see even one part of the temple that isn't ruined. (assuming an airbending stance) Do you know what you did? You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse! (pointing at the Mechanist) This whole place stinks! This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way. I've seen it when the monks were here. I know what it's supposed to be like. (advancing on the Mechanist with each question) What are you doing? Who said you could be here? Our gliders. Nature knows where to stop. I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same. (lowering his head) I'm sorry, this is the last part of temple that the same as it was. I want it to stay that way. Thanks. (from o.c.) Spirit. That's the something you're talking about. Just make sure to keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug! Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one. I've been thinking. If you wanna see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you. This is a nightmare.(turning and pointing a finger at him in anger) You're making weapons for the Fire Nation! When are they coming? You can't give them more weapons. The deal's off! (striking the emissary with an air whip) Get out of here! You're leaving empty handed! I'll tell ya how. (Pointing to the sky) We have something they don't. (Screens moves fast to open sky where a few gliders are moving) Air power! We control the sky. That' something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!(smiling) Good, we'll need it. (jumping off Appa and opening his glider as he lands) We'll have to start without him. We've got'em on the run! We need more slime! Look! They're retreating! You know what? I'm really glad you guys all live here now. It's like the hermit crab (he picks one up from the stone bench.), maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home. And now you protect each other."," Was it realistic? Was that how it was back then? (sitting down next to Sokka) Do you think we'll really find airbenders? (folding her arms) Are you saying I'm a liar? Huh! They really are airbenders! (pointing to the glider) I don't know, Aang. That kid seems pretty spirited! Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so... different. I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same. You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temples origins. Hey! It's just like the one in the other Air Temple. Aang? (looking over the side of the terrace in fear) I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something. No! I can't believe I'm flying! Teo was right about the air! All I had to do was trust it. Let it carry me. (her voice echoing from o.c.) Wait! How do I land this thing? What if I land (swallows bug) – eh! Blech! Yech! Bug! Bug! That was a bug! Aang, what are we gonna do? How can we possibly keep them all away? (to Aang) Ugh, if only we knew. Hmm. That's actually pretty smart. Yes, but where's Sokka with the war balloon? Those things are unstoppable! Water? Can you get me close to one? Come on, Sokka, where's that war balloon? No! Sokka! Hold on!"," Sorry! (whittling) You want me to be like you, or totally honest? I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing basically. (appearing in the far background with Momo and pointing ahead) What do you mean they're not? Those guys are flying! We better find some solid ground before it finds us! Wow! This glider chair is incredible! (running forward) Wow! So better! (approaching the candles) Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same. You put spark powder in the candle! (after catching the fingers) Aaahhh! These lanterns are terrible! I can't see. Why would you want to use fireflies for light? Okay, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room. (checking his part of the door for leaks) So this place is an explosion waiting to happen? (sniffing the air) Ugh! Week old egg smell! How could something that's so small you can't even see it make such a big stink! Yeh! If we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up... Then, if there's a leak... And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!(angry) You make weapons for the Fire Nation!? This is bad! Very bad! Thank you. You're a genius! See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it airborne, but once you did, it just kept going. (He demonstrates with a model that goes up and hits the ceiling.) You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air? A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon. (He demonstrates by pulling a string connected to the lid that opens and closes it.)  Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs. Smoke, slime, fire and... Hey, why aren't they shooting at us? (cutting a rope with his knife) Then I guess they won't see this coming. Oh no! That was the last one! Rotten eggs! There! That's where the gas is escaping! It's the only bomb we've got! We're going down! Get ready! Aang, you were right about air power.

Uhh... this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about? Yeh! They're not fair. If you won't teach Katara, then – Then I won't learn from you! (through gritted teeth) I'm trying! That bad? Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl. Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating. That was amazing! I... I was just showing Katara a few moves. I'm sorry, I – Uh, Katara... I'm sure she didn't mean that. You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher. Go Katara! Go get her. Hey Katara! Good to see ya here."," Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight. They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!

Prince of what?(with a mock bow) My apologies, Prince Sokka. Very smooth. I've waited for this day my whole life! I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master! What do you mean you won't teach me? (Walking up to Pakku) I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me “no”! (hands on her hips) But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe! I don't want to heal, I want to fight! Well your rules stink! Wait! (To Pakku) Aang didn't mean that. You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk. Um, hi. Are you Yagoda?(walking forward and sitting down) I guess I am. Thanks for the lesson. Huh? (smiling) No, I don't think I'm ready for that yet. My grandmother gave my mother this necklace, and my mother passed it down to me.(starting backwards in surprise) Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name?(looking away) She never told me. If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave? How's warrior training going?(raising her head with a smile) Why didn't I think of that? (Getting up.) At night, you can teach whatever moves you learned from Master Pakku. That way you have someone to practice with and I get to learn waterbending. Everyone's happy! But you're never happy. Come on, Aang. I got it! That wasn't me. Yes – please! Fine. No! No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!(a look of challenge on her face) I'll be outside – if you're man enough to fight me!(taking off her coat and throwing it at Sokka, hitting him in the face) I know! I don't care!  I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy! So, you decided to show up? (He walks past her.) Aren't you gonna fight? You can't knock me down! But you still won't teach me, will you? Come back here! I'm not finished yet! No it's not, it's mine! Give it back! My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you? But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage. (walking up to Pakku) Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life. That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage.

Sokka, Southern Water Tribe. (after a brief pause, trying desperately to strike up a conversation) So... uh... you're a Princess! (She nods and smiles) You know, back in my tribe, I'm kinda like a Prince myself!(angry) A lot of things! Uh, do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here!(turning back to Yue and trying to recover) So it looks like I'm gonna be in town for awhile. I'm thinking maybe we could...(then lamely) do an activity together? Princess Yue! Good morning! (Coming up beside her boat on the sidewalk along the side of the canal and walking with her boat as it floats down the canal.) Hey, how about that picnic last night? Boy, your Dad sure knows how to throw a party. Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left. So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other. (eyes wide, clearly excited) Yes! At... a place! For... some time! Great! I'll see you – aahh!(to himself, as he falls over backwards to lie flat on the sidewalk) That's okay, it was worth it. (Shot zooms out and rotates) See you tonight.

No, no, see, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a princess, and I... I'm just a southern peasant. It's okay. You don't have to say anything.

21,The Avatar State,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=201," (as he falls) Aaahhh! (he lands on the floor of the Air Temple) Oof! Nah. Just a nightmare. (unsettled) I was in the Avatar state, but I was outside my body watching myself. It was scary. I was scary. Appa, yip yip! (humbly) I try not to think about it too much. (alarmed) What?! No I'm not! See, it's this special state where— (with uncertainty) Right... but I'm don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar state, much less what to do once I'm there. (o.c.) General Fong? (looks down in uncertainty) I'm in. (looks up with determination) I'll fight the Fire Lord. (quietly) I told the general I'd help him... by going into the Avatar state. (pleading) Katara, I'm just being realistic. I don't have time to do this the right way. (He looks sad and almost ashamed.)  Ten-fold energy, huh? (slurps; twitch, twitch, twitch)  (speaking in a fast, high-pitched, hyper voice while zipping everywhere on his air-scooter) Is it working, is it working? I can't tell! Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar state 'cause I don't have a good view of myself! Am I talking too loud? (collides with a column, his air ball disappear and his shawl falling over his head.) Ooof! (cheerfully) I love surprises. Aaahhh! (looks at his hands and holds them up) Still not glowing. This is just mud! Aaaaachoooo! (o.c.) Sure. I'm really glad you told me that. But I still need to do this. No, you don't. Every day more and more people die. I'm already a hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war. I have to try it. (sadly) Goodnight. (as the water vortex knocks him overboard) Aaahhh! (softly) Sokka. Sokka, wake up. I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar state. Yes. (apprehensive) Do you think the general will be mad? The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose. So, I guess that's it. I'm sure. I can only reach the Avatar state when I'm in genuine danger. (gets hit with the desk) Ugh! (about to hit the ground) Aaahhh! What are you doing? I am not your enemy! I won't fight you! You can't fight forever! Aaahhh! Don't hurt her! Stop this! You have to let her go. (desperately) I'm trying... I'm trying! (hysterical) You don't need to do this! What do you mean? (tired and remorseful) I'm sorry, Katara. I hope you never have to see me like that again. (The two look up as Fong begins to speak.) (Cut to Fong, who walks forward, spreading his arms.)  You're out of your mind."," Aang? Do you wanna talk about it? (respectfully) Thank you, Master Pakku.  (calls back as they fly off) Say hi to Gran Gran for me! (Cut to a scene looking down at the ship as Appa flies toward the screen.)  (pleased) ""Mighty Katara""? I like that. Aang still needs to master all four elements. (irritated) No, nothing's decided. We already have a plan. Aang's pursuing his destiny his way. Aang, no. This is not the right way. There's a right way to do this. Practice, study, and discipline. (angrily) If you two meatheads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine. Go ahead and glow it up! (She exits to the right. Aang rises and starts after her.)  (o.c.) Can we talk about something? Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton? It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you. I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore. I'm not saying the Avatar state doesn't have incredible—and helpful power. But you have to understand, for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary. I don't understand. (quietly) I can't watch you do this to yourself. I'm not coming tomorrow. (She begins to walk off toward the screen, but pauses.) Goodnight. (She exits off screen.)  I wonder what crazy thing they're trying now. (Cut to Momo, who makes a purring noise and closes his eyes.) Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay. (to Sokka) What's going on? Aaahhh! (grunts, straining) I can't move! (sinking deeper) Aaahhh! Aang, I'm sinking! (terrified) Aaahhh! Please! I think we're all set."," (excitedly) There it is! Not bad, not bad. But, sir, the thing is Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar state. Why not? Remember when he took out the Fire Navy? He was incredible. Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord. (Looking bored.) I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death. Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar state. (groggily) Wha...? You sure? (accepting) Okay. What can he say? You're the Avatar. Who knows better than you? Aang! The general's gone crazy. He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar state! (nervous coaxing) Good bird/horse thingy. Katara! No! (Fong sinks the bird creature's legs into the dirt and Sokka gets tossed from his ostrich, landing in the hole of one of the discs.) Waaaahhh! Oof! (bonks Fong on the head and knocks him out) Anybody got a problem with that? (Soldiers all shake their heads in unison) (Sokka dismounts from the creature. The soldiers approach the others and bow. The creature runs off in the background.) "," (dejectedly) Three years ago today I was banished. I lost it all. (He looks up suddenly.)  I want it back. I want the Avatar, I want my honor, I want my throne. I want my father not to think I'm worthless. We don't need anymore useless things. You forget we have to carry everything ourselves now. (accusingly) What are you doing here? (furiously) Don't call me that! (with shocked and quiet disbelief) Father regrets? He... wants me back? (o.c., happily) We're going home. After three long years. It's unbelievable. (Zuko walks behind a thoughtful Iroh, carrying some folded clothing. He walks off to the right of the screen.)  Did you listen to Azula? Father's realized how important family is to him. He cares about me. (defensively, turning his back to Iroh) You don't know how my father feels about me. (He stiffens) You don't know anything. (nastily) I think you are exactly what you seem a lazy, mistrustful, shallow old man who has always been jealous of his brother. (happily surprised) Uncle! You've changed your mind! We're finally going home. (wistfully) Home... You lied to me!"," (to her men) My brother and my uncle have disgraced the Fire Lord and brought shame on all of us. You may have mixed feelings about attacking members of the royal family; I understand. But I assure you, if you hesitate, I will not hesitate to bring you down. Dismissed. I'm sorry, Captain, but I do not know much about the tides. Can you explain something to me? Do the tides command this ship? (condescendingly) You said the tides would not allow us to bring the ship in. Do the tides command this ship? And if I were to have you thrown overboard, would the tides think twice about smashing you against the rocky shore? Well, then, maybe you should worry less about the tides who've already made up their mind about killing you and worry more about me, who's still mulling it over. 'Almost' isn't good enough! (o.c.) Hello, brother. Uncle. (arrogantly) In my country, we exchange a pleasant 'hello' before asking questions. (She gets up and walks over to face Zuko.) Have you become uncivilized so soon, Zuzu? Hmm... must be a family trait. Both of you so quick to get to the point. (She shatters one of Iroh's shells with her sharp nails on this last word. Iroh's face darkens.) I've come with a message from home. Father's changed his mind. Family is suddenly very important to him. He's heard rumors of plans to overthrow him—treacherous plots. Family are the only ones you can really trust. (Her voice and face soften.) Father regrets your banishment. He wants you home. (o.c.) Did you hear me? You should be happy. Excited. Grateful. (Camera returns to show her pleasant expression.) I just gave you great news. (interrupting him angrily) Don't interrupt, Uncle! (addresses Zuko. The camera pans to show his scarred face in the foreground, and Azula walks up beside him.) I still haven't heard my thank you. I am not a messenger. I didn't have to come all this way. I can see you need time to take this in. I'll come to call on you tomorrow. Good evening. (Azula walks off screen to the right.)  Brother! Uncle! (Cut back to Zuko and Iroh, both bowing. Iroh opens one eye slightly, watching the soldiers beside him.) Welcome. I'm so glad you decided to come. (pleasantly) Set our course for home, Captain. (smugly) Like I've never done that before. You know Father blames Uncle for the loss at the North Pole. And he considers you a miserable failure for not finding the Avatar. (o.c.) Why would he want you back home, except to lock you up where you can no longer embarrass him? Anyone who harbors these traitors will face the wrath of the Fire Lord. (menacingly) There will be no place left to hide.",
22,The Cave of Two Lovers,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=202," So, you were showing me the octopus form. (blushing, slightly flustered) Oh... yeah. Thanks. Just... people. You guys are nomads That's great! I'm a nomad. (flatly) I know... you just said that. Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere. They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler. Yeah. Thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground and we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable. (terrified) AAAAAHHHHH! So all you need is to trust in love to get through these caves? We can make it. Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map, also. We found the exit! No... it's a tomb. It must be the two lovers from the legend. That's who's buried here. How are we gonna find our way out of these tunnels? What? Katara, what is it? Right... (totally clueless) Where are you going with this? (surprised) Us, kissing? (dreamily) Us... kissing... (also tries to laugh it off) Yeah, heh, heh. (He points at her for additional emphasis) I definitely wouldn't wanna kiss you!  (trying desperately to recover) No, no, I mean... if there was a choice between kissing you and dying... What? I'm saying I'd rather kiss you than die. (He holds clasps his hands together in a gesture of appeasement) That's a compliment. (dejected) What is wrong with me? (gloomily) We're gonna run out of light any second now, aren't we? Then what are we gonna do? It's made of some kind of crystals. They must only light up in the dark! (uncertainly) So... um... (worried) What about Sokka? Just like the legend says we let love lead the way. So, are you guys gonna come to Omashu with us? Okay. Thanks for everything, Moku."," (teasingly) What, like you're ready to go right now, naked guy? Right. Let me see your stance. (evaluates Aang's form and comes over to correct it) Your arms are too far apart. See, if you move them closer together you protect your center. You got it? Okay, let's see what you got. You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang. (gesturing negatively with her hands as Sokka resurfaces behind her, Momo landing on his hand) We're not river people. Sokka's right. We need to find King Bumi so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe. (skeptically) Is this real or a legend? (terrified) AAAAAHHHHH! That's no campfire, Moku. (sympathetically) It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine. (less confidently) I hope. Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to. Everyone be quiet. Listen. Aang, look! This isn't the exit. These pictures tell their story. (voice-over) They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages.  (voice-over) The villages were enemies so they could not be together. (voice-over) But their love was strong and they found a way. (voice-over) The two lovers learned earthbending from the badger moles. They became the first earthbenders. (voice-over) They built elaborate tunnels so they could meet secretly. Anyone who tried to follow them would be lost forever in the labyrinth. (voice-over) But one day the man didn't come.  He died in the war between their two villages. (voice-over) Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power. She could have destroyed them all.  (voice-over) But instead she declared the war over.  Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace.  (voice-over) The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu. The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love. (reading the inscription) Love is brightest in the dark. I have a crazy idea. (hesitantly) Never mind, it's too crazy. I was thinking... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love. And here it says 'love is brightest in the dark' and... (she turns to face him, but doesn't yet meet his eyes) has a picture of them kissing. (shyly) Well... what if we kissed? See? It was a crazy idea. (tries to laugh it off) Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine that? (offended) Oh, well I didn't realize it was such a horrible option. (Leaning over at him in anger) Sorry I suggested it! (turning to Aang, infuriated) Well, I'm not sure which I would rather do! I think so. What can we do? That's how the two lovers found each other. They just put out their lights and followed the crystals.  That must be the way out! (excitedly) Let's go! Sokka! Why is your forehead all red?"," You guys are gonna be done soon, right?  We've got a lot of ground to cover if we wanna make it to Omashu today. I can be ready in two minutes. Seriously. (He lifts his hair to look at them and lets his arm drop lazily back into the water.) Whenever. (with an accusing finger pointed at Chong) Who're you? (firmly) Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy I guess it's up to me. (Katara, whose hair is being braided by Lily, looks crossly up at Sokka at this) We need to get to Omashu. (Counting off the verboten distractions on his hand) No sidetracks, no worms, and definitely no rainbows. (emphatically) O. Ma. Shu. I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine. (terrified) AAAAAHHHHH! (unenthusiastically) Secret love cave. Let's go. How far are we from the tunnel. Labyrinth ! (in exasperation) Curse! What exactly is this curse? (aggravated) That's it! There's no way we're going througbrh some cursed hole! That's Fire Nation. They're tracking us. Everyone into the hole! We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last? (while grabbing and stomping out the torches she lit) It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time! I'm gonna make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been. Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through. This doesn't make any sense; we already came through this way. There's something strange here. There's only one explanation. The tunnels are changing. (cynically) Right. If only we listened to you. Noooooooo!  (defensively) At least I'm thinking of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku. (explodes) Yes! We're all thinking of ideas! No, they were trying to get away from something. (trying to sing to the one note he's strumming and not doing very well) Badger moles, coming toward me. Come on guys, help me out. How did you guys get out? Really? We let huge ferocious beasts lead our way. (sullenly, but also blushing) Just play your songs. The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about - the destination.  I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O... (devastated with realization) Oh, no..."," (frustrated) I didn't find anything to eat. I can't live like this. I wasn't meant to be a fugitive. (kicks at the ground angrily) This is impossible! (more calmly) Uncle... what are you doing? We need food, not tea. I'm going fishing. (horrified) You didn't! (in repulsion) Yah! (losing his patience) We're not taking any more chances with these plants! We need to get help. (musingly) If the Earth Kingdom, discovers us, they'll have us killed. Earth Kingdom it is. (standing and talking quickly) Yes, we're travelers. (hesitantly) Names Of course we have names. I'm... Lee. And this is my uncle, uh... Mushi.  Sorry, but we need to be moving on. I haven't seen my father in many years. Yeah. (quietly, without much feeling) Thank you. (quietly, but intensely) I know. They're about to show us a little more kindness.

23,Return To Omashu,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=203," I can't believe it. I know the war has spread far, (he turns to face his friends) but Omashu always seemed...untouchable. (firmly) No. I'm going in to find Bumi. (defiantly) What? If he's still what? This isn't about finding a teacher. This is about finding my friend. Does that answer your question? Stop making so much noise. It's just a purple pentapus. Thank you, sewer friend! Somewhere he can't earthbend. (looking up and around, cut to Aang's p.o.v. as he pans around) Somewhere made of metal. So, is King Bumi with you guys? Is he leading the resistance? Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation. (Cut to a panning shot of the resistance fighters around them, all clearly listening to Aang, the camera ultimately resting back on the Resistance Leader.) But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day. (turning to face her) No. I'm not leaving until I find Bumi. Sorry Momo, I'll feed you later. Flopsie! (climbing on top of Flopsie) Come on, Flopsie. You gotta help me find Bumi. Yip Yip! Oh...I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go! (sadly) We looked everywhere. No Bumi. It's from the Fire Nation governor. He thinks we kidnapped his son. So...he wants to make a trade. His son (the camera rotates around Aang for additional effect) for King Bumi. I don't think so. I'm sure the Governor wants his son back as much as we want Bumi. It's a new day. (Cut to a wide, overhead shot of the group and the sun and mountains behind them) I have a good feeling about this. He's here. We're ready to trade. Bumi! Hang on! We're gonna get you out of here. (smiling and laughing) Just like old times, isn't it, Bumi? (not understanding because of the noise) It's good to see you too! Hang on, Bumi! Our ride's here! You could earthbend all along!? I don't understand. (Getting angry, the questions becoming rapid fire) Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi!? I know! (holding up his fingers as he counts them off) There's positive jin when you're attacking, and negative jin when you're retreating. (startled, looking at his hand which now has three fingers raised) There are three jins? (with dawning understanding) That's why you surrendered, isn't it? I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending. Hey, Momo!"," This is horrible, but we have to move on. I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people around who can teach you earthbending. That wasn't as bad as I thought. Sorry. We were just on our way home. Uh...he has pentapox, sir. (a pleasing, earnest look in her eyes) Um...it's highly contagious! ...and deadly... Let's find Bumi and get out of here. Aang, what are you doing? Aren't you coming with us. Oh no. Did someone get left behind? (leaning over to hug the baby from behind) Ooo, you're so CUTE. Mmmmm... (picking the baby up, who still clearly wants to play with the club) Does that look like the face of a killer to you? We've got to get the baby out of here! There's Aang!"," Up until now, it was. Now Ba-Sing-Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left. Aang, stop. We don't even know if Bumi's still... (refusing to meet Aang's eyes) ...around. (from o.c.) A secret passage?  Why didn't we just use this last time? (The cap pops off, releasing a huge gout of greenish sewage, some of which washes over Sokka.) Ugh! Ew! Aaahhh! Aaahh! Aahhh! They won't let go! Help! Aaaak! Uuuuuu....It's so awful...I'm dyiiiing... Where would they be keeping him? Suckers! You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox. The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta ACT sick, too. Ya gotta sell it! (putting his arm around an earth kingdom citizen next to him) Now that's what I'm talkin' about. Okay everyone! Into sick formation. No! Bad Fire Nation baby! Oh...alright. You realize we're probably walking right into a trap? (stopping his whistling to answer, a smile on his face) Way ahead of ya! I seem to manage!  We can catch him!",," You're right. The royal procession is dead weight. If I want to catch my prey, I must be agile....nimble. I need a small, elite team. It's time to visit some old friends. Ty Lee, could that possibly be you? (smiling) Please, don't let me interrupt your... (raises an eyebrow, searching for the right word and failing) whatever it is you were doing. Tell me, what is the daughter of a nobleman doing here? Certainly our parents didn't send us to the Royal Fire Academy for Girls to end up in... (cut to a shot of the efforts with the platypus bear, Azula continues, with a slight note of contempt in her voice) places like this. I have a proposition for you. I'm hunting a traitor. (Looking at her wrist a bit absent mindedly) You remember my old fuddy duddy uncle, don't you? I would be honored if you would join me on my mission. I'll take your word for it. Well, I wouldn't want you to give up the life you love just to please me. Of course, before I leave, I'm going to catch your show. I will. Incredible. Do you think she'll fall? Then wouldn't it make it more interesting if you removed the net? You're right, you're right. That's been done. (After a short pause) I know. Set the net on fire. Brilliant, just brilliant! (She looks back down at the Circus Master) Oooo, what kind of dangerous animals do you have? (cutting him off) Release them all! What an exquisite performance. I can't wait to see how you'll top yourself tomorrow. Really? (hugging Mai) It's great to see you, Mai. I have a mission (she puts one of her hands on each of their shoulders) and I need you both. Yes, I'm so sorry to hear about your son, (she crosses her legs in front of her) but really, what did you expect by just letting all the citizens leave? (She stands, suddenly angry, and looks down upon him) My father has trusted you with this city (she makes a slashing gesture with her left hand) and you're making a mess of things! You stay here. (Mai and Ty Lee stand up behind her) Mai will handle the hostage trade so you don't have a chance to mess it up. (Cut to several exterior shots of the still smoking city and several construction projects within, continue Azula voice over) And there is no more ""Omashu"". I'm renaming it in honor of my father, the City of New Ozai.  (to Mai, Bumi grinning behind them all) I'm sorry, but a thought just occurred to me. Do you mind? We're trading a two year old for a king. (She turns to Bumi) A powerful, earthbending king. (turning back to Mai) It just doesn't seem like a fair trade, does it? (in surprise) The Avatar! (Cut to a quick shot of Aang spiraling upwards with his glider, then back to Azula, who looks smug) My lucky day. It's not just Zuko and Iroh anymore. We have a third target now.",
24,The Swamp,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=204," What? (Wiping his forehead with his left hand) I didn't even notice. (looking down at the swamp with a slightly fierce expression) I know this is gonna sound weird, but... I think the swamp is... calling to me. No, I... I think it wants us to land there. I don't know... Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it? Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this... bye swamp. Yip! Yip! Where's Appa and Momo? (calling fruitlessly) Appa! Momo! No... and the tornado... it just disappeared. (concerned) Maybe... we should be a little nicer to the swamp. Sokka, the longer we're here the more I think you shouldn't be doing that. ...except for them. Guys? (calling out) Katara! Appa! Hello? (from o.c.) Who are you? Hey, come back! Who are you? (airbending himself to his feet) I was chasing some girl. (helping Katara to her feet) I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress. What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here.  Yeh, the center... (from o.c.) It's the heart of the swamp,  (angry) Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us? We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land. I get how the tree is one big thing, but, the whole world? But what about my vision It was someone I had never met. (to himself) Time is an illusion... so, it's... (looks up at Hue, realization spreading across his face) someone I will meet? I think I know how to find them. (Aang leans forward and places his hand on the tree root. He closes his eyes and begins to concentrate.) Everything is connected. Come on! We've got to hurry! Appa! But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?"," (coming up from behind) Is something wrong? I don't know... There's something ominous about that place. Sokka! You've got an elbow leech! Where do you think? You couldn't find them? (also concerned) Maybe you should listen to Aang. (Cut to an overhead shot of the dark swamp) Something about this place feels... alive. (calling out) Appa! Momo! What was that!  Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched? (calling out) Aang? (Cut to a closer shot) Sokka? Hello? Hello? Can you help me? (She squints, then cut to again to water tribe woman's back) Mom? (More loudly and running towards the figure) Mom! I can't believe... (displeased with Sokka's attitude) Well, I've been wandering around looking for you! What girl? (after a pause and looking down) I thought I saw Mom. You saw something too? Okay... so where's here? (Gesturing in front of them) The middle of the swamp? So, who are you then? But what did our visions mean? Hey, you guys are waterbenders! The South Pole. No, it' all ice and snow. What about the visions?"," (to Aang, o.c.) Hey, you takin' us down for a reason? (from o.c.) Aang! (Aang flinches and the camera zooms backward to a wide shot of Aang and Sokka, now visible behind him in the saddle) Why are we going down? Are you noticing now? (holding his stomach) It is telling ya where we can get something to eat? No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on. Yes! See Even Appa and Momo don't like it here. You better throw in an extra ""yip""! We gotta move! (freaking out) Where! Where! (angrily ripping off the leech and throwing it near Katara) Why do things keep attaching to me! We better speed things up! (continuing to chop through the vines) Aang, these are just plants! Do you want me to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" as I swing my machete back and forth? (slightly annoyed and gesturing with his machete) I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here, and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can. There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them. We'll have to make camp for the night. Nothing. Just swamp gas. (The gas begins to swirl about them) Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here. I think we should build a fire... (slightly sarcastically) No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine. (He turns to address a nearby root) Right, swamp? (he grabs the root and begins to shake as he fakes a reply in a funny voice) ""No problem, Sokka!"" Please, we're all alone out here. (terrified) Right, except for them. Aang! (He is cutting a path in the vines before him with his weapon) Stupid swamp! Dumb, ugly vines! Katara! (Turning to another vine in his way) You think you're so tough, huh? Hello? (Sokka walks forward) Yue? (Sokka grabs the side of his head and looks away) This is just a trick of the light... swamp gas... (he turns around, his back to the ghost) I... hit my head running away last night. I'm going crazy. What do you guys think you're doing! I've been looking all over for you! (sarcastically) Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations! (again after a pause and looking down) Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here. (turning away) I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything. (Turning back to the others) Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot. (frustrated) It's just a tree. It can't call anyone! For the last time, there's nothing after us (cut to a wide shot of the three standing on the tree root, Aang on the left, Sokka on the right, Katara in the middle) and there's nothing magical happening here. There's someone in there! He's bending the vines! He's the Avatar. Stuff like that happens to us - a lot. (to his friends) See? Completely reasonable. Not a monster (he sheathes his machete as he follows Aang and Katara who have now exited the frame), just a regular guy defending his home. Nothing mystical about it. Sure ya did. It seems real chatty. Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to Appa and Momo. Hue? (examining his kabob) Tastes just like arctic hen. (Looking up at them) So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa? (Points at the catfish crocodile) You've got plenty of those big things wandering around. Nice Slim! (To his sister in a slightly sanctimonious tone) Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here. Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp. I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug!  That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count. (To Hue) The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down. (trying to sweep the issue under the carpet) Well, no accounting for weather. Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp.", This is humiliating! We're royalty. These people should be giving us whatever we want. We're not performers.,,
25,Avatar Day,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=205," My staff! Yip, yip! (initially from o.c.) Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka. Avatar Day? There's a holiday for the Avatar. Who knew? Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated. (smiling) That's the biggest me I've ever seen. That party-pooper's my friend!  (calmly, raising his hand in a non-threatening way) No, I'm not, I... It's true. (airbending himself down to where Katara and the Mayor stand) I'm on your side. You think that I... murdered someone...  (cringing in revulsion) Huh! (to everyone) Give me a chance to clear my name. (confidently) I'll gladly stand trial. No problem! How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money? I can't. I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer, either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence.  (shrewdly) That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective. So you'll help me with my case? (hopefully) You think so? (uncertainly) I don't know... (smiling) You guys are great. Then how can I prove my innocence? Right... evidence. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to tell you what really happened. And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one... (Aang blanks) Uh... Oh, yeah... (to the crowd) You see, I have very large feet.  (unpersuasively) Furthermore, your... temple matches your statue. But... I was in a painting at sunset. (wraps it up fast with a big smile) So there you have it! I'm not guilty! (in an uncertain, mock female voice) Hey, everybody. (He drops the fan slightly to reveal his painted face and his eyes blink to a sound effect) Avatar Kyoshi here. (confused) So... what just happened? I said I would face justice, so I will. (calmly) Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil."," My scrolls! Ahhh! There's no time! (cheerfully) That's correct! I hope that's okay. Look! They made a giant Kyoshi float. Aang, look! Hey, what's that guy doing? Why not? Aang helps people. (defensively) Aang would never do something like that. No Avatar would. (pointing an accusing finger at the crowd) And it's not fair for you all to question his honor! (disdainfully) I think what ""Master Swish"" is trying to say is that you're supposed to be out saving the world. You can't do that locked up in here. (playing along) Yeah! Back home he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky. (getting worked up) So if they were built at the same time, that means... That's a big hole in the mayor's story, but it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence. Where'd you get that? He couldn't be here, Koko. Oyagi! Aang is in jail. The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life. (touching the kimono) She had exquisite taste. These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous! (with realization) Wait a minute... big feet? (cut to a brief vision of the small footprint by the Chin temple) Little footprints? (cut back to the present, then happily) There's no way! (with mock respect) You're right. I'm sorry. Please. (unimpressed) Brilliant, Sokka. They point east. So the sun must have been in the west. (formally, and in voice over at first) Honorable mayor, (cut to a shot of the kids and the Mayor at Aang's jail) we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar. We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence. Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony. This isn't just any witness. I'm going to call... (gestures widely with her arms) Avatar Kyoshi herself! Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something. (pleading) Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here. Uhh... you kind of confessed. Sorry. (worried) Community service! Please stop on community service. (halfheartedly) Happy Avatar Day, everyone."," (spitting and startled) What are you doing in my mouth! Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries. Come on, come on, come on! Ahhh! Wait, my boomerang! Oh, I see. There's time to get your scrolls and time to get your staff, but no time for my boomerang?  (resigned) Oh. I feel like I've lost part of my identity. Imagine if you lost your arrow, or if Katara lost her... (cut to Katara, looking confused) ... hair loopies. (picks up basket, then, dejected) I used to be boomerang guy... And here comes Avatar Roku. And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food. Now a torch; that's a nice prop. It's bright, dangerous... (inhales deeply)... smells manly. But I'm not sure I could carry it off. So some people don't like you. Big deal! There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you. Now let's bust you out of here. (upbeat) Sure you can! A little... swish, swish, swish! Airbending slice! ... and we're on our way. How're we gonna do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago. (self-importantly) Well, I guess I could be classified as such. (bragging) Everyone wanted to blame it on a polar leopard, but I figured out that it was Old Man Jarco wearing polar leopard boots. See, a real eight hundred pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks. Okay, I guess I am pretty good. Fine. But I'm gonna need some new props. I'm ready. What? This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone. And we know that the statue was built after Chin died. (interrupting) Shhh! I wanna solve it! That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple. You're right.  We need to go to Kyoshi Island. (looking ridiculous with his hat and pipe) They say it was Kyoshi. (with feigned casualness) So, uh... what's Suki up to? Is she around? (sadly) Oh, well... that's great. (musing with an affected voice) These fans... they were her weapons, no? Ahem. (Sokka clears his throat, interrupting her) Special outfit Hat and pipe These things mean anything to you? (dramatically) Aha! There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint and therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene! (spits out his pipe at the surprise information) Three hundred and seventy years... wait, (grabs Oyagi by the lapels) are you sure it was today? This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise; it took place at sunset. Look at the shadows.  (shoves Katara out of the way) If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime. (points his pipe dramatically and the magnifying glass swing in front of his eye) She has an alibi! (quietly) You can do it, Aang. Just remember the evidence. (quietly prompting) The footprints! (aside to Katara, both still smiling) He's dead. (whispers) What are you doing? (adjusting his magnifying glass and accepting Katara's reason) I do believe in the power of stuff. (happily) Boomerang! You do always come back! What is this? This is by far the worst town we've ever been to."," (walking away) What does it matter where they came from? (avoids the question) Do you like your new teapot? There's no honor for me without the Avatar. (abruptly) Then there is no hope at all. Uncle, I thought a lot about what you said. (without malice, but also without hesitation) It's helped me realize something. We no longer have anything to gain by traveling together. I need to find my own way.",,
26,The Blind Bandit,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=206," (voice over) Look, there's a coupon on the back. The first lesson is free. (disappointed) He's not the one. Excuse me, (runs over to the boys, cut to wider shot of the three) but where is this earthbending tournament exactly?  How did you get them to tell you? Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here. (hesitantly) I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think, Sokka? I think she is. She waited, (turns to Katara) and listened. I will! I don't really want to fight you. I want to talk to you. Please, wait! Please listen! I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you. Wait! If we want to find The Blind Bandit, the Earthbending Academy is a good place to start. We need to talk to her. Do you guys know where she lives? (almost lost in thought) That's because we're asking about the wrong person. In my vision, I saw a girl in a white dress with a pet flying boar. Know anybody like that? Flying boar is good enough for me. (to his friends) Let's check it out. That's the flying boar from my vision. Come on. How did you know it was me? (airbending himself to his feet) Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth. And then I had a vision in a magic swamp and... Allow me. I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but (looking suggestively over at Toph) I can't do that (cut to a close up of Toph's unhappy face) without finding an earthbending teacher first. Then she must be a great earthbender, (cut to a view of Toph's feet, Aang continues in voice over) probably good enough to teach someone else.  Ow! Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is. What's your problem? Good night, buddy. That's amazing. Is that why you became The Blind Bandit? Then why stay here where you're not happy? (pause, then with a smile) You could come with us. Go. I'll be ok. Hit it harder! I'm sorry, Toph. Not like her. Toph! What are you doing here?  You're gonna be a great teacher, Toph. Okay."," Then you should get it. You deserve something nice. (slightly annoyed) Alright, then don't. Who knows? This Master Yu could be the earthbending teacher you've been looking for. (in a comforting tone) I'll take care of this. Hey strong guys, wait up! You ready to find an earthbending teacher? Because we're going to Earth Rumble 6! Oh, (looks over her shoulder coyly) a girl has her ways. This is just gonna be a bunch of guys chuckin' rocks at each other, isn't it? How about The Boulder? He's got some good moves. She can't really be blind. (cut to a close up of the Bandit's eyes that pans right) It's just part of her character, right?  (incredulously) How did she do that? (smacking her brother) Don't boo at him! (sarcastically) That is a big relief. Yeah, I didn't think so. Let me handle this. (pointing at student #2 and saying angrily) You're not telling us everything! Hey, I've got my eye on you. You're the one whose bag matches his belt. (cutting Aang off) What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar, and if he doesn't master earthbending soon he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord. (voice over) ""If you want to see your daughter again, bring (cut to a pan right of Toph's parents and Yu) 500 gold pieces to the arena."" (cut to a shot of Katara and Sokka, the open scroll still in her hand) It's signed ""Xin Fu and The Boulder."" (turning to address Lao) We're going with you. What about Aang? Toph, there's too many of them. We need an earthbender. We need you! Don't worry. We'll find you a teacher. (cut to a profile shot of the two, the air blows Katara's braids) There are plenty of amazing earthbenders out there."," (voice over) It's pricey, but I really do like it. (turns to her with a smile) I do, don't I? (turns back with an exaggerated gesture) But no. It's too expensive, I shouldn't. You know what? I'm gonna get it. Ha, ha! Oh, I got to remember that one. What was I thinking? I don't need a new bag. Why'd you let me buy this?  I guess that's why. (hopefully) That's what I paid for. (excitedly) Ha ha! Whoo! (giving thumbs down) Boo! Boo! Go back to the Fire Nation! (looking at Fire Nation Man's impact point) Yeah! Whoo! The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt! (cut to a close up of Sokka looking insane and making taunting faces) Yeah! Whoo! I think she is... (yells) going down! (crying) No! (cupping his hands to his mouth) Go Aang! Avenge The Boulder! Boo! No talking! Way to go, champ! I gotta admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag. It matches the belt perfectly. Nicely done. (whispers with a smile) Water Tribe. (whining) Don't answer to twinkle toes. It's not manly! Look, we all have to do our part to win this war. And yours is to teach Aang earthbending. Whoever took Aang and Toph left this. (somberly) I can't believe it. (screaming) I have the Boulder's autograph! Here's your money. Now let them go. I'm trying! (he and Katara look at each quickly) Well, we'd better get out of here - before your dad changes his mind again. Sorry.",,," (pointing at the Boulder and in a mocking tone) Sounds to me like you're scared, Boulder. (points again at her opponent) Whenever you're ready...The Pebble. (throws her head back) Ha ha ha! Do people really want to see two little girls fighting out here? Somebody's a little light on his feet. What's your fighting name, (cut to Aang, the Bandit continues in voice over) The Fancy Dancer? Where'd you go? There you are! Whoever you are, just leave me alone. What are you doing here, twinkle toes? How did you find me? Not my problem. Now get out of here or I'll call the guards. Guards! Guards, help! I thought I heard someone. I got scared. What's your problem? Relax. Look, I'm sorry about dinner. Let's call a truce, ok? Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing. I see with earthbending. It's kind of like seeing with my feet. I can feel the vibrations in the earth, and I can see where everything is. You, that tree, even those ants. (frustrated) My parents don't understand. They've always treated me like I was helpless. Yeah. They're my parents. Where else am I supposed to go? Yeah. You guys get to go wherever you want. No one telling you what to do, that's the life. It's just not my life.  We're being ambushed. You think you're so tough...  ...why don't you come up here so I can smack that grin off your face? Yes, I can.  (pointing at the camera) Let him go. I beat you all before, (making a sweeping motion with her hand) and I'll do it again. Wait.  (turning her head left and looking o.c.) They're mine. Dad, I know it's hard for you to see me this way, but the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think I am just isn't me. I love fighting. I love being an earthbender. And I'm really, really good at it. I know I've kept my life secret from you, but you were keeping me secret from the whole world. You were doing it to protect me. But I'm twelve years old and I've never had a real friend. So now that you see who I really am, I hope it doesn't change the way you feel about me. (hopeful) It has? But dad! I'm sorry, too. Goodbye, Aang. My dad changed his mind. He said I was free to travel the world. Good idea. (slyly) Speaking of which, I want to show you something. Now we're even.  Um, I'll take the belt back. Ow!     "
27,Zuko Alone,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=207,,,,"  Could I get some water, a bag of feed, and something hot to eat? No. (turning around and putting his hand on his sword hilt) No. (turning back to the merchant) Maybe a chicken flew over. No kidding. I'm, uh... I can't. I should be moving on. Uh-uh. Far away. Hey mom, want to see how Azula feeds turtle ducks? Stupid turtle duck, why'd she do that? (emphatically) I am not cart wheeling. I don't care. I don't want to play with you. (with a gesture of frustration) Girls are crazy! (reading the inscription) ""Never give up without a fight."" How would you like it if cousin Lu Ten wanted dad to die? (voice over) You're holding them all wrong. Keep in mind, these are dual swords. (he takes the swords and begins to demonstrate moves for the boy) Two halves of a single weapon. Don't think of them as separate, because they're not. They're just two different parts of the same whole. Trouble. No. I need to move on. Here. (offers him his dagger) I want you to have this. Read the inscription. The other one. (getting up, his cheeks flaming) Put an apple on your head and we'll find out how good I am! Does that mean we won the war? What are you talking about? Uncle's not a quitter. (angry) How do you know what he should do? (looking down, sadly) He's probably just sad his only kid is gone... forever. Great Grandfather won, because... (struggling)  I'd like to demonstrate what I've been learning.  (dejected) I failed. What are you...? (sarcastically) Ha-ha, Azula. Nice try. Liar! Stop it, you're lying! (holding his blanket for security) Dad would never do that to me. (almost chanting) Azula always lies... Azula always lies... Azula always lies... I'll get your son back. (in a threatening tone) Let the kid go. It doesn't matter who I am, but I know who you are. You're not soldiers. (cut to a shot of Zuko's face) You're bullies. Freeloaders, abusing your power. Mostly over women and kids. You don't want Lee in your army. You're sick cowards messing with a family who's already lost one son to the war. (sleepily) Mom? (with confidence) My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai. (sheathing his swords) Prince of the Fire Nation and heir to the throne. It's yours. You should have it. Mom? Mom, mom!  (slightly panicked) Where's mom? Not funny, Azula. You're sick. And I want my knife back, now. Where is she?"," (whispers to Ty Lee) Watch this.  Mom, can you make Zuko play with us? We need equal teams to play a game. You won't have to. Cart wheeling's not a game, (under her breath) dumb dumb. We are brother and sister. (her voice becoming sickly sweet) It's important for us to spend time together. Don't you think so, mom? (voice over) Here's the way it goes.  Now what you do is try to knock the apple off the other person's head. Like this. (to Ty Lee) See, I told you it would work. If Uncle doesn't make it back from war, then dad would be next in line to be Fire Lord, wouldn't he? I still think our dad would make a much better Fire Lord than (looking at the doll with disdain) his royal tea loving kookiness. You waste all your time playing with knives. You're not even good. (getting up and walking over to him) By the way, Uncle's coming home. No. It mean's Uncle's a quitter and a loser. Oh yes, he is. He found out his son died and he just fell apart. (leaning against a nearby pillar) A real general would stay and burn Ba Sing Se to the ground, not lose the battle and come home crying. (mocking) Fire Lord Azulon. Can't you just call him ""Grandfather""? He's not exactly the powerful Fire Lord he used to be. Someone will probably end up talking his place soon. Because even though his army was outnumbered, he cleverly calculated his advantages. The enemy was downwind and there was a drought. Their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes. (whispering to Zuko) You'll never catch up. Shh! (in a sing-song voice) Dad's going to kill you. (normal voice) Really, (turning to look at him with a leer) he is. Fine, don't believe me, but I heard everything. Grandfather said dad's punishment should fit his crime. (imitating Azulon) ""You must know the pain of losing a first born son, by sacrificing your own!"" (coming and sitting on his bed) I'm only telling you for your own good. I know, maybe you could find a nice Earth Kingdom family to adopt you. (innocently) I don't know. No one knows. Oh, and last night, Grandpa passed away. Who's going to make me? Mom?",

Better safe than sorry. (Hesitant) Should we... do something? Okay, okay, you both need to calm down. I... can see that. (urgently in voice over) I don't think so, Sokka. I don't know, but this time I'm going to make sure we lose 'em. (Cut to an over head shot of Aang, Katara, and Toph all lying down.) Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what (covers his head with the top of his shirt, muffling his voice) or who it is. That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us. Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly. Appa, yip yip! Sokka, we'll be okay. (Cut to Appa flying over the hills with the rising sun in the background) We can't keep flying forever. (yawns) So, what's the plan? Appa fell asleep! Wake up, buddy! Appa's exhausted. Alright, alright! Everyone's exhausted. Let's just get some rest. No, no! She's not blaming you! What? You're blaming Appa?! How dare you blame Appa! He saved your life three times today! If there's anyone to blame, it's you! You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not! He is! Appa's carrying your weight! (Camera zooms in on him) He never had a problem flying when (cut to Toph from over Aang's shoulder) it was just the three of us! What did I just do!? I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher. Now she's gone. I have a plan. Toph was right. Appa's fur was leaving a trail right to us. But now that he's clean, no more trail! (Cut to him standing next to Appa's wet head) He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here. (He moves to a pile of fur and places it into a bag) I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail and lead the tank off course. Alright, you've caught up with me. Now who are you and what do you want? So what now? (standing up) I'm not running. Zuko! (laughs a bit) Zuzu?  Katara!"," (Lifting her right foot out of the fur and balancing on her left) Oh, gross! Ah, the beauty of spring. (Appa, who sticks his tongue out to reveal it's covered in fur, sneezes, blowing fur everywhere.) Stop, Appa, stop!  (unamused) I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group because you two are disgusting. So, Toph, usually when setting up camp we try to divide up the work. (Cut back to her, Aang and Sokka can be seen working again in the background) Well, actually, what I'm trying to say is, uh, some of us might fetch water while someone else might set up the fire pit or put up the tent. (Momo flies down dropping nuts into Katara's hand and flutters by her head.) Even Momo does his fair share. (Cut back to her, as she becomes steadily more annoyed) Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish... Never mind. Hey Toph, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each others' nerves. (angrily) I meant all of us. (half-heartedly) Goodnight. Should we leave? What is that thing? Actually, can you help us unload? Well, yeah. (Cut to Toph while Katara approaches her from the right) That and everything else. You're a part of our team now and... (Hand on her hips.) That's not the point.  Ever since joining us you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful. Sugar Queen! (Toph closes off her rock tent by brining a slab of earth up to cover the opening to Katara.) D-Did you just slam the door in my face!   How can you be so infuriating!  (Cut to the back of her head) Both? (Shouting, turning quickly to show a hysterical face.) I'm completely calm! The stars sure are beautiful tonight.  Too bad you can't see them, Toph! Seriously, what is that thing? (Cut to her as she pulls a bag close to lay her head on it) That's good, because Toph wasn't going to help anyway. It could be Zuko. We haven't seen him since the North Pole. (jokingly) What's wrong with ponytails, ponytail? Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky! Let's get out of here! It's those three girls from Omashu! I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu. Are you kidding? The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them (Cut to her alone) one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary. (Cut to shot of her and Toph) Every time we land, those girls are there, so we'll just have to keep flying. I'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap. Of course, we could have gotten some sleep earlier (Cut to shot of Toph on her stomach asleep on the ground) if Toph didn't have such issues. (Cut to her with an annoyed yet sarcastically placid face) I'm just saying, maybe if you helped out earlier we could've set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation! No, I'm blaming her! I know. We're all just trying to get used to each other, and I was so mean to her. (Sarcastically) Thanks, Sokka. We need to find Toph and apologize. Are you sure that he's okay to fly? How did they find us? He's too tired! Come on, Appa, just a little further! (voice over) You did it, Appa!  (in a frenetic voice) Well, you know! (with a genuine smile) Thanks. Zuko, I can help!"," That's not grass. Appa's shedding. It's not that bad, Katara.

Hey, I'm just enjoying the show. Hey, how is a guy supposed to sleep with all this yelling and earthquaking!  Well, how far away is it? (Covering his head again, muffling his voice slightly) Maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes. Okay, forget about setting up camp. I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep. (Cut to him in his bag from the front, his head perched up on the ground.) Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world.  (gesturing to his hair, speaking in a muffled voice) This is a warrior's wolf tail. Anyway, whoever's chasing us, they couldn't have followed us here. So... now would everyone just (cut to him with finger to mouth) shhh!  Aww, don't tell me... Always the optimist. Actually, Toph, there's four of us. (Dropping his stance and making a furious expression at Toph, while shouting in an equally furious way) I can still fight! Well, we wanted to find out who they were. We found out. (Sheathing his boomerang and turning around.) Now let's get out of here. Oh no, the sun is rising! (Cut to shot of the basket, Sokka sitting at the lip of it gesturing to the sun off screen) We've been up all night with no sleep. (Speaking desperately, shot cuts to him making erratic arm movements and crazy facial expressions) Are you sure!? I've never not slept before! What if I fall asleep now and something happens? And something always happens! Yes! Sleep! Okay, we've put a lot of distance between us and them. The plan now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep. Wait. (Cut to him drinking from a cup, the other two visible over his shoulder) Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks. No problem. Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us? Toph couldn't have made it too far. (Momo begins screeching.) What is it, Momo... oh no! Katara! Appa, come on! We need to go faster! Not good, not good!  We just need to make it across that river! (voice over) We made it! We're safe! Good try, but no. How ya doing? Thanks Appa.

(In an imitation of Zuko's voice) I must find the Avatar to restore my honor. (Cut to a shot of Aang who is nonplussed, then back to Azula) It's okay. You can laugh. It's funny. Now... Now it's over. You're tired and you have no place to go. You can run, but I'll catch you. Do you really want to fight me? I was wondering when you'd show up, Zuzu. I'm not going anywhere. Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors all working together. I'm done. (she raises her hands in a gesture of surrender) I know when I'm beaten. You got me. A princess surrenders with honor."," Hey, you guys picked a great campsite. (cut to a shot of Toph's feet in the pile of white fur) The grass is so soft. Excuse me, (She walks in between the two breaking them apar.) does anyone have a razor... (She lifts both arms to reveal a mass of white fur emerging out of both of her sleeves, under her arms) ...because I've got some hairy pits! (Cut to her lying down) Hey, don't worry about me, I'm good to go. (Cut back to her as she takes the straw from her mouth) Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight. I don't need a fire, I've already collected my own food, and look, (Now sitting upright, she uses her earthbending to create a stone tent.) my tent's all set up. (Irritated) I don't understand. What's the problem here? Yeah, you do seem pretty tired. Well, goodnight.  There's something coming toward us! It feels like an avalanche... (Aang, Katara, and Sokka all enter the shot and stand behind her) But also not like an avalanche. Ahh, land, sweet land! (Using earthbending to propel herself to her feet and slinging her bag over her shoulder.) See you guys in the morning! (Cut to her looking back.) Really? You need me to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag? (Irritated) Look. (Pointing at Katara) I didn't ask you to help unload my stuff. I'm carrying my own weight.  What? (Doing a half turn and pointing at Katara again.) Look here, sugar queen, (Drops arm and continues, Katara makes a gesture like she wants to interject.) I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending, so don't you talk to me about being selfish! That thing is back! And how does it keep finding us? (Cut to her laying face up with her head on her bag.) Oh, I didn't realize baby still needed someone to tuck her in bed. Who's Zuko? I can feel it with my own two feet! We can take 'em. Three on three. Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't count you. You know, no bending and all. Okay. Three on three plus Sokka. I still think we could've taken them. Don't know... too tired to think. (shouting) What's going on!  (Screaming, and springing awake slamming her hands on the ground causing it to break a little) What!? No! I want to hear what Katara has to say. You think I have issues? You're blaming me for this!? Hey!  I never asked you for diddly doo da. I carry my own weight!  Besides, if there's anyone to blame, it's sheddy over here! Yeah! You wanna know how they keep finding us? He's leaving a trail everywhere we go! I'm outta here. (she takes it) You seem a little too old. I know what you're thinking. I look like I can't handle being by myself. You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea.  People see me and think I'm weak. They want to take care of me. But I can take care of myself by myself. (laughs) So, where is your nephew? Is he lost? So... now you're following him. Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it. (standing up) Thank you. No, thank you for what you said. It helped me. Oh, and about your nephew? Maybe you should tell him that you need him too. I thought you guys could use a little help."
29,Bitter Work,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=209," Today's the day! Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! And this place... i-it's perfect! Don't you think, Sokka? Oh, you're still sleeping, huh? (whispering) Sorry! Good morning, sifu Toph. Well, if you think I should... So what move are you going to teach me first? Rockalanche? (He shoves his fist down to illustrate the move.) The trembler? (He pretends like he's has someone in a hold and trembles slightly.) Oh! Maybe I can learn to make a whirlpool out of land! Sounds good! Sounds good! Like a rock. Got it. I'm ready. Maybe there's another way. (He takes up a fighting stance and begins to walk toward the boulder.) What if I came at the boulder from a different angle? Whoa! (sarcastically) Yeah, thanks Katara! I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say. I know. I'm sorry. (sadly) No. I don't think I do. Yeah... that sounds good. (dejectedly) I don't want to talk about it. (frustrated) I know I know I know I know, I get it, alright! (He lets the ball of water fall back into the pond.) I need to face it head-on, like a rock. But I just can't do it! I don't know why I can't, but I can't. I guess it's earth. Thanks, Katara. Sifu Katara. As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have. Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't... (There's another crack as Toph smashes another nut, and Aang cringes.) That's an antique, hand crafted by the monks... (There's another crack and Aang cringes again, growing more frustrated.) It's a delicate instrument! Ohmmmm... (annoyed) Meditating here! We'll find him faster if we split up. Sokka! Are you okay? (scratching his head pensively) Hmm... I bet I can airbend you out of here. (forlornly) I can't. I can't do it. I can't do that either. It would just be really... uncomfortable. Thanks, Sokka. (Cut to behind the two. Aang crouches down.) This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position. If I try, I fail. But if I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. Aww, what a cute name for a little baby sabertooth mooselion cub.  It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. Whatcha doin' out here, little guy? Did you lose your mama? (nervously) Hey, there... we found your cub! (He smiles and raises the baby into the air. The baby yawns. The mother growls and Aang puts the baby on the ground. It runs to its mother and then passed her into the bushes, squealing.) See? We have no problem with you! We're friendly.  Oh no! (Aang leaps up on a rock outcropping away from Sokka. He cups his hands around his mouth and begins to shout at the mooselion.) Whoo-hoo! Look at me! (determined) I won't. What? You were there the whole time?  (angrily) Why didn't you do something? Sokka was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could've gotten him out and helped us get away! (forcefully) Enough! I want my staff back! (still angry) What? But... (happily) I can't believe it!  No problem, Sokka! (cutting Sokka off) Hey, Katara, look what I can do! Appa! Appa! I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted! Physically and mentally unmovable! "," (sleepily) Hey... you never call me sifu Katara. I don't understand what went wrong. (She glances at Toph and points at Aang.) He did it exactly the way you did. I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction.  Sorry, Toph, but are you sure this is really the best way to teach Aang earthbending? (nervously) Heh. Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on, okay? You know this block you're having is only temporary, right? You do know that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding it... Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air? That's why it's so hard for you to get this. (Cut to a view of Aang's reflection that then pans up to show Aang himself.) You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. (Cut back to Katara.) I know you will. (Katara reaches behind her and breaks off a reed. She hurls it at Aang without warning.) Think fast! Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master. Hey Aang, have you seen... It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him. You found him!  You did it! I knew you would! (She glances at Toph.) You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?"," Rock beats airbender! You're awfully cute, but unfortunately for you, you're made of meat. Just a bit closer... Gotcha! (He falls deeper into the crevice and drops his sword. He's stuck up to his shoulders. He struggles to free himself but doesn't budge.) You are a lucky little meat creature. You probably think I deserve this, don't you? (The baby mooselion peers over Sokka's forehead and looks at him.) Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things! Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it. You're cute. (The mooselion begins licking its paws.) Okay, you've convinced me. If I get out of this alive, it's a comically correct vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty.  (offscreen) Hey, it looks like my karma is already paying off! That's okay! I got it! Now come back, boomerang.  Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff, if I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? OW! (The band holding Sokka's hair in the ponytail comes off after a strong tug by the baby mooselion and Sokka's hair becomes a fuzzy mess.) That's all I got! It's pretty much my whole identity! Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy! (The baby mooselion exits to the right.) But I'm willing to be Sokka the veggies and straight talk fellow! ...Deal? Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat? (grunts) Stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!  Seriously, Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it? (annoyed) If you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph. You can't? Why not? Uncomfortable? (Cut to a close-up of Sokka in the crevice.) Well, I wouldn't want to make you feel uncomfortable. Awkward position... I think I know the feeling. Hmm. How about that. (He motions to the mooselion.) Aang, this is my friend Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang. Really? He looks nothing like a sabertooth mooselion. (frantic) Aang, this is bad! You gotta get me outta here!  This is really bad! (Cut to Aang, who looks increasingly worried as Sokka speaks.) Please, Aang! You have to earthbend me out, there's no other way! (terrified) Please don't leave me again. What are you doing here? Aww, this is really a wonderful, touching moment. So, could you get me out of her so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug? Yeah, no crushing, please. The whole time that I was in that hole, not knowing if I would live or die, it makes a man think about what's really important. I realized..."," Uncle! You were unconscious. Azula did this to you.  It was a surprise attack. I hope I made it the way you like it. So uncle, I've been thinking. It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her. I see. That's why we're drinking tea To calm the mind. I'm ready to try it!  Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning, it keeps exploding in my face! Like everything always does! (frustrated and enraged) What turmoil? But I don't feel any shame at all! I'm as proud as ever! Well... my life has been nothing but humbling lately.  Why are you telling me these things? All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff. (excitedly) You can teach me to redirect lightning? I think so.  Great! I'm ready to try it with real lightning! (annoyed) I thought that was the point (Cut to Iroh, whose eyes twitch as Zuko continues.) you teaching me how to protect myself from it. Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning. (defiantly) You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it! And now I can give it back! (Lightning strikes in the distance. Cut to a close-up of Zuko's face as the rain pours off of it. He glances up at the sky.) Come on! Strike me! You've never held back before! ",," Good morning, earthbending student! Sorry, snoozles. We'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can. Let's start with ""move a rock"". The key to earthbending is your stance. (She lowers herself and widens the distance between her feet. Aang tries to imitate her.) You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element. (She shoves Aang, causing him to stumble to the side.) If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself.  Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple. (She lunges forward and punches, causing the boulder to shoot off into the distance, slamming into the side of the canyon.) Okay, you ready to give it a try? No, that's the problem. You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. (She knocks her fist lightly against the side of Aang's head. He winces slightly.) There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickity trick that's going to move that rock. (She shoves Aang. He cries out and falls down offscreen.) You've got to face it head on. And when I say head on, I mean like this! Thanks, Katara. A gentle nudge. I'll try that. (Cut to Toph shouting.) Keep your knees high, twinkletoes! Rocklike! Rocklike! This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock. (She walks off screen, then quickly lunges toward Aang, who recoils slightly.) Get in your horse stance! (Aang widens his stance. Cut to Toph standing in front of Aang with a trail leading up an angled cliff behind her.) I'm going to roll that boulder down at you. (She points up the hill at a large boulder sitting at the top of the trail.) If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock. (Cut to a close-up of Aang's face. His mouth opens and he looks surprised and scared. Katara looks on with concern in the background. Cut back to Toph.) Like this. I'm glad you said something. (She reaches down and grabs Aang's belt.) Actually, there is a better way. (She jerks off Aang's belt and blindfolds him with it.) This way he'll really have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara! There's nothing to say. You blew it. You had a perfect stance and perfect form but when it came right down to it you didn't have the guts.  Yeah, you are sorry. If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you could at least give it the pleasure of smushing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender?!  Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better.  Aang! I found these nuts in your bag. (She holds up a green bag with a crudely-drawn picture of Aang's face on it.) I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it. You know, I'm really glad you feel that way, because I also have this great new nutcracker. (in a mocking tone) It's not the only delicate instrument around here. Just enjoying the show. Pretty much. I guess it just didn't occur to me. Do it now. Earthbend, twinkletoes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast, and even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got the stuff. DO IT! (excitedly) You did it! You're an earthbender. Actually, you should probably let me do that. You're still a little new to this. You might accidentally crush him. Yep. It worked wonders."
30,The Library,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=210," Shhh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise. Just watch. (watching as the prairie dog descends back into the hole) Heheheha, yeah! I'm putting an orchestra together. (Looking up at Sokka) I'm learning the elements as fast as I can. (Cut to a close up of Aang.) I practice hard everyday with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrows off. (voice over) Your turn, Katara. (cut to a shot from the side of Aang holding the map open and Katara looking at it) Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?  Oh yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring, and I usually don't use the word pristine. It's one of nature's wonders. Must have changed ownership since I was here.  (looking up at the man) No worries, I clean up easy. Thanks. I try. The southern temple. (nervously) Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product? Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here. (petting Appa) Don't worry buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with Toph. Nothing. We just like architecture. What do you have against humans? Ow. (cut to a close up of Aang) Uh, yeah, I'll vouch. We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit. (cut to a shot from the side of everyone standing on the bridge) You have my word. Uh, oh, I know! (pulls a scroll from his shirt collar and presents it, revealing it to be a Fire Nation wanted poster of the Avatar. The sound of a trumpet plays to give dramatic effect.) Ha!  Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things. I always knew I was special. Sokka, where are you going? Firebender. Wow, I gotta hand it to you Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation, for sure. Great, you must have broken it. (pleading) We had no choice. Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love. What are you doing? We've gotta get back to the surface. Why are we doing this?  You can't possibly check every single date. Come on, eclipse! Where's Appa?"," Yeah. What's wrong with having a little fun in our downtime? Alright, we'll finish our vacations, and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence. (placing her finger on the map) How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing. (voice over) You've made a lot of trips into the desert. (giving Sokka's head a small shove) I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka. It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant ornate building from the air. (disappointedly) Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. The building in this drawing is enormous. You got something against libraries? Oh, right. Sorry. I have an authentic waterbending scroll. Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left handed? They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation. Maybe these dials represent dates and times. (points to the dials) Sokka, try entering that date from the parchment you took. Hey wait, what happened to the sun? That makes sense. (Cut to a close shot of Sokka and Aang as Katara walks in from the right.) I mean, think of what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge. He's sinking the building! We've gotta get out of here! (voice over) Sokka, let's go! Don't be stupid, we'll find out later. But- (voice over) Hurry, Sokka! Just go!"," (voice over) What's out here?  Orchestra, huh? Well la dee da. This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about? We should be making plans.  There's no time for vacations. (crossing his arms) Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the fire nation. Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house? (mimics the action of knocking on a door, accompanied by the sound effect) Knock, knock! Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? (Humorous background music plays as Sokka says this. He leans towards Aang, closing his fists and dropping them to his sides) I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're gonna win this war. I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy. (signaling to the bartender) Excuse me! So professor, you're obviously a well traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated. What, no Fire Nation? (straitening his back) Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place? Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh? If this place has books from all over the world, do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation? A map maybe? Then it's settled. (cut to the shot of the group around the table. Toph is sipping her drink.) Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation (cut to a shot of Sokka as he points his finger into the air. The background changes to a rushing one) AT THE LIBRARY! (crossing his arms) You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time. Professor, would you like to see our sky bison? Down there. What's that? What kind of animal is that? No, this is the library. (points up at the spire) Look! (voice over) It's completely buried. That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look. Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world? (smiling nervously and waving his hand in protest) What? Oh, no, no, no destroying, we're not into that. (trying to think of an answer) Um, knowledge, for, knowledge's sake. I'm not lying. I'm here with the Avatar, (points behind with his thumbs and pulls Aang in front of him) and he's the bridge between our worlds, he'll vouch for me. (pats Aang on the shoulder before nudging him in the back.)  Oh, great spirit, (cut to a shot of Sokka holding a piece a string between his fingers. The others, standing behind him, look puzzled.) check this out! (quickly ties the string into a butterfly shaped knot and holds it out, accompanied by the sound of chimes) Ta da! It's a special knot! That counts as knowledge. Bright enough to fool you.Eh, I've seen weirder. (reading) The darkest day in Fire Nation history. It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else. I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day. This could be promising. (Cut to a shot of the group running through the library.) The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here. (frustrated) That's so unfair! (places his hands against his head) Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago. I need to know what happened on the darkest day. Hello, little weird fox guy. Um, sure, I'll guess I'll follow you. Uh, this is beautiful, but, how is it helpful? Shh! Katara! (places his hand in front of his mouth and begins whispering, eyeing the fox warily) Not in front of the fox, he's with the owl. It's not broken. (voice over) The sun is behind the moon, it's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it! (grabs Aang by the shoulders and turns him) Something awful happened on that day, I don't know what, but I do know why. Firebenders loose their bending during a solar eclipse! (pushes Aang and lets go of him, causing the Avatar some discomfort) Sorry.Fine, you earned it. We've got to get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse, (cut to a close up of Sokka) then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is goin' down!  You don't understand. (raises fist) If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous. We need this information. But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna happen. No, we won't. (gestures to the side) If we leave this place we'll never get the information. (raises fist) Aang, come with me to the planetarium, I need cover. (voice over) Katara, take Momo and get out of here. Go! Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be. (removes his bag from his shoulder and turns the dial)  I don't have to. (turns the dial) We just have to check every date before Sozin's comet arrives, because after that... Well, try not to think about that. (voice over) That's it, the solar eclipse! (cut to a wide shot of the planetarium as it darkens) It's just a few months away. Got it. (puts the date into his bag) Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se. That's called Sokka style. (swings his fist to the side as he says this) Learn it! Wait! (cut to a shot from behind Zei, who is sitting between two bookshelves. Sokka, Katara and Momo can be seen climbing the rope in front of him) Professor, let's go! We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming. (Katara and Sokka jump at and hug each other. Momo jumps off of Katara's shoulder) The Fire Nation's in trouble, now!",,," (kneels and places her palm on the ground) A lot actually. There's hundreds of little- We did make plans. We're all picking mini-vacations. You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library?  (sarcastically) Mm, sounds like good times. (waving her hand to gain the others attention) Uh, hey? What about me? When do I get to pick? (frustrated) Aw, does this place even exist? Shouldn't you have mentioned that before?  (in excitement) There it is! That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it. (voice over) Actually, (cut to a pan left shot of Top, with Aang, Katara, Sokka and Momo standing in the background) that won't be necessary. The inside seems to be completely intact, and it's huge. I say you guys go ahead without me. I've held books before, and I gotta tell you, they don't exactly do it for me. Let me know if they have something you can listen to. What's up? So, you like flyin'? Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground, where I can see. Well, I don't see the way you do. I feel the vibration in the ground with my feet, (cut to a closer shot of Toph as she picks up a handful of sand and lets it sift through her fingers) but this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy. Not that there's anything wrong with fuzzy. I already told you, I don't want to snuggle. The library's sinking. The library's sinking!  What is it now? Who's there? Don't make me put this down. No, stop sinking! No! (sadly) I'm sorry Appa. "

You just didn't care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone! That's all any of you guys care about yourselves! You don't care whether Appa is okay or not! (Aang stalks off, sulking angrily.)  I'm going after Appa. Appa! Appa! (Stares across the horizon but sees nothing)No... NO! (hopelessly) What's the difference? We won't survive without Appa. We all know it. It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is. I'm awake. I couldn't sleep. (joyfully) Appa! (angrily) I'm sorry, okay! It's a desert cloud; I did all I could! What's anyone else doing! What are you doing? (darkly) Maybe we can find some sandbenders. Yeah... look at the shape. Momo! I'm not losing anyone else out here. (angrily) You stole Appa! Where is he  What did you do to him  Where is my bison?!  You tell me where he is now! (enraged) You muzzled Appa?! (In an unearthly voice) Tell me where Appa is!"," Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our lives. We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now. Aang, wait! We'd better start walking. We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse. We have to get that information to Ba-Sing-Se. Come on guys, we've got to stick together. Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it. I'm sorry, it's all we have. Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants! (Katara grabs Toph's wrist and runs over to Sokka and Momo.)  I don't know... Okay, I think you've had enough.  I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang. Uhhh... What is that?  Let's just keep moving. I hope Aang's okay... I'm sorry, Aang. I know it's hard for you right now, but we need to focus on getting out of here. Come on, Aang! We can do this if we work together. Right, Toph?  Sokka?  Any ideas how to find Ba-Sing-Se?  Ugh... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! Aang, get up. Everybody hold hands. We can do this. We have to. I think we should stop for the night. This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink. No, he hasn't. Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library. Sokka, I was there. (takes Sokka's bag) No, but we can find out which way Ba-Sing-Se is. We can use the stars to guide us. That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day. (She sighs.) Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours. Come on, get up. We need to go. Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit. (sadly) It's just a cloud. Wait! A cloud! (To Aang Here, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch. Wow... there's hardly any in here. Trying to keep everyone together. Let's just get moving. We need to head in this direction. A boat?  It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use! And look! It's got some kind of compass on it! I bet it can point us out of here! Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it. We're going to make it! The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts. (gasps) That's what the compass is pointing to! That giant rock! It must be the magnetic center of the desert. Maybe we can find some water there! (irritated) You've been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave?!  Sokka, there's nothing there. We have to get out of here! I'm completely out of water to bend! Come on, we're going down. Toph, shoot a rock right there. Fire! Yes. Now let's move. On your left! We found the sailer abandoned in the desert. We're traveling with the Avatar. Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba-Sing-Se. Are you sure?"," Who's going to save our lives now? We'll never make it out of here. You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride? (breathing hard) Can't you watch where you're - Right. Sorry. If I sweat any more, I don't think sticking together will be a problem. We're drinking your bending water? You used this on the swamp guy! Not anymore! Look! There's water trapped inside these! (Sokka holds up some cactus for Katara, but she backs away, pushing Toph back as well.)  Suit yourself. It's very thirst-quenching, though. (In a strange, echoing voice) Drink cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier. (moves across the sand like an inch worm) It's the quenchiest! Who lit Toph on fire? How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean? It's a giant mushroom! Maybe it's friendly! (in the echoing voice from before) Friendly mushroom!Mushy giant friend! Why don't we ask the circle birds?  Momo, no! You've killed us all! Oh, right. Bending. (offended) What! I didn't steal anything! Who told you that?! (pointing an accusing finger at Momo) It was you! You ratted me out! Appa? But why would Princess Yue need him? She's the moon! She flies by herself! (dreamily) Take it easy little lady. I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here. (breathes deeply) I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice. And look!  This tastes like rotten penguin meat! Awww I feel woozy. I have a natural curiosity. What are you doing?! That rock almost crushed me! I got this one. I guess my head's not as clear as I thought. Yeah! You got it! She got it, right?  Just get out of here! Run!"," Maybe we should make camp. You know these guys?  Too bad you don't have any old friends that don't want to attack you. No one here is going to help us. These people just look like filthy wanderers. You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho?  What are you old gasbags talking about?  I thought you said he would help! Now that you played Pai Sho,are you going to do some flower arranging, or is this club going to offer some real help? What's going on? Is the club meeting over?  Ba-Sing-Se? Why would we go to the Earth Kingdom capital? ",," I couldn't! The library was sinking! You guys were still inside and -(Toph swings her arms wide.)  I can hardly feel any vibrations out here. The sandbenders snuck upon me and there wasn't time for - No. Katara, can I have some water? It does taste swampy. Can I get some of that cactus? What? What is what? As far as I can feel, we're trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding. I got nothin'. Is there any more water?  Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it just tastes like sand. I never thought I'd miss the taste of mud so much. Ow! Crud! I am so sick of not feeling where I'm going! And what idiot buried a boat in the middle of the desert?!  Believe me, I kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations. (happily) A rock?  Yes! Let's go! Ahhh... Finally! Solid ground! I don't think this is a normal cave. This was carved by something. There's something buzzing in here. Something that's coming for us! Sorry, I can't tell where they are in the air!  I recognize the son's voice. He's the one that stole Appa. I never forget a voice. You said to put a muzzle on him!"
32,The Serpent's Pass,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=212," So, did you figure out what routewe're gonna take?  (calmly) Katara, it's ok. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se, and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse. So, are you guys headed to Ba Sing Se too?  (hesitantly) Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.  Uh, no one told us we had to have passports. (holds up hands) That won't be necessary.  Are the other Kyoshi warriors around? (annoyed) I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me! (calling down to them) I'll talk to the lady for you.  (pleading) But she's pregnant, and all of their stuff was stolen. You have to make an exception. What if we gave them our tickets?  But... (reassuringly) Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the serpents pass.  (evenly) I don't know. The monks used to say that hope is just a distraction. So maybe we do need to abandon it.  Hope isn't going to get us into Ba Sing Se, and it's not gonna find Appa. We need to focus on what we're doing right now, and that's getting across this pass. (steps through gate)  You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa, I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that.  Thank you for your concern Katara. (He walks away, Katara watching him leave with a worried look) I'll distract him. Katara, get everyone across.  (softly) I've been going through a really hard time lately. But you've made me... hopeful again. (thoughtfully) I thought I was trying to be strong, but really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it reminded me of how I feel about Appa.....and how I feel about you. I promise I'll find Appa as fast as I can. I just really need to do this. (Tophhands him his staff)  (softly) I know. Thank you Katara. (glancing over) You ready Momo?  (looks sadly to his lemur friend) Sorry Momo, Appa's gonna have to wait."," Waterbending bomb! Yeah! Sorry. (in a hushed voice) Shush up about Appa. Can't you at least try to be sensitive? (Sokka and Katara glance up at Aang)  (surprised) Oh, well, ok. I'm glad you're doing better.  Great, we can travel through the Serpent's Pass together. (the three travelers react with horror.)  (sarcastically) Hmmm, peaceful ferry ride...or deadly pass?  I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation. (cuts to a scene of refugee camp, showing a woman feeding a crying child)  You look so different without your makeup, and the new outfit.  (sadly) Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se. (she looks over at Aang, who looks away) (stepping forward, reads) It says, ""Abandon hope"".  (incredulous) What are you talking about? (somberly) Ok, if you say so. (everyone begins to follow Aang through the gateway)  You know, it's o.k. to miss Appa. What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa, and now it's like you don't care about him at all. (walks up beside him)  But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope, and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring. C'mon, you need ahug. (She holds out her arms to him, but he bows politely to her)  Everyone single file. Aang, I need help. (smiling, he hands staff to Toph and begins bending)  What is that thing?  (outraged) Sokka! Sokka, Calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home. It's called a baby, and I helped todeliver plenty of those too. (speaking with authority) Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water. Toph, I need you to make an earth tent. A big one. (Toph creates a tent of stone slabs around the refugees) Suki, come with me. (both enter the tent) You're doing great Ying. (calling back) Sokka! Where's that water? Get ready to push. (Sokka enters behind her) One, two, three...PUSH!  (from inside) It's a girl! Aang, you have to come see this. (steps back inside)  (awed) She's beautiful. (gently) You'll find him Aang. "," (holding out dripping map) Sure, 5000 year old maps from the spirit library, just splash some water on 'em. (pointing out map features) Okay. We just got out of the desert, so we must be around here, and we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here. It looks like the only passage connecting the South to the North is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass.  It's the only way, I mean it's not like we have Appa to fly us there. (rolling map) Then to Ba Sing Se we go, no more distractions.  Well, we are desperate.  (stepping forward) Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar!  (in file behind the others) Alright, we scammed that lady good!  (intimidated) Is there a problem? (eyes narrowing) Do I know you? Suki!!  (They hug.)  I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then, nothing major. (stretches and flexes casually, pats his bicep)  I can't believe we gave up our tickets, and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass.  (cautiously)Are you sure that's a good idea?  I do, it's just...Nothing. I'm glad you're coming. (Suki walks past him angrily, Sokka looks down and then follows)  (voiceover) This is the Serpent's Pass I thought it would be more windy, you know, like a serpent. Hmm, I guess they misnamed it.  (shouting) They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go! Suki, are you ok You have to be more careful! (leads her past Toph) C'mon! Suki, you shouldn't sleep there. (walks up and takes bedroll) Who knows how stable this ledge is? It could give way at any moment.  (laying bedroll near his) You're right, you're right. You're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself...Wait! (abruptly leaps between her and bedroll) Oh, never mind. I thought I saw a spider, but you're fine. (pats Suki's shoulder reassuringly, while she looks mortified)   Yeah, it really is.  I know you can.  It's so hard to lose someone you care about. (looks away) Something happened at the North Pole, and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again. (indignantly) Who is this guy? Is he taller than me? (rises to his feet)  Is he better looking?  Oh... (looks to her wistfully)  I can't.  (turning away) No, you shouldn't be. (leaves her standing beneath arch)  (pointing upward) I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass.  Suki, you know about giant sea monsters. Make it go away! (beseechingly holds up Momo) Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you.  (calling out) Toph, come on. It's just ice.  (shouting encouragement) You're doing great! Just follow the sound of my voice!  You're almost there. (the serpents tail crashes through the bridge, shattering its entire length and sending Toph plunging into the lake) I'm coming Toph! (pointing excitedly) There's the wall! (view pans past rocky barrens toward a vast wall that fills the distant horizon) Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se. (apprehensively) What's wrong?  (in rising panic) What! Now! Can't you hold it in or something? (completely panicking) This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real... human.... thing! No no, I'm good this time. (Sokka stands and follows Toph into the tent. Moments later Katara appears at the entrance.)  (dubiously) It's so...squishy looking.  See ya in the big city. (standing) Whoa, hold on. Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye? (stunned) So you came along to protect me?  (gazing into her eyes) You talk too much."," (grimly) Look around, we're not tourists, we're refugees. (sips from wooden bowl) Ugh! (spits over railing) I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt... I'm tired of living like this.  (looking out over lake) Hello. (turns) I'm in. (grimly) I've realized lately, that being on your own isn't always the best path. ",," You're sure that's the best way to go?  Deadly route. (whacks Sokka's arm painfully) Great pick, Sokka. (strides forward) I'll take care of this. My name is Toph Bei Fong, and I'll need 4 tickets.  (arrogantly) It is your pleasure. As you can see I am blind, and these three imbeciles are my valets.  Is my Seeing-Eye Lemur.  (Momo hops up on her shoulder.)  Thank you very much.  I can't believe you're still complaining about it.  What does it say?  (muttering) Thanks for saving my life Toph. Hey no problem Sokka.  (puts a foot out onto ice, shrinks back) Actually, I'm gonna stay on my little island where I can see. (A huge coil of the Sea Serpent crashes down behind her, sending her out onto the ice with a cry of fright.)  Ok, I'm coming! (begins inching sideways across the ice span)  (acidly) It's hard to ignore.  (screams and thrashes helplessly) Help! I can't swim!  (dramatically) Oh Sokka, you saved me. (plants a big kiss on Suki's cheek)  (fatally embarrassed) Oh...well...heheh. (limply) You can go ahead and let me drown now.  (leaning over to Sokka) So, you want to go see the baby? Or are you going to  faint like an old lady again?  She sounds healthy.  Say hi to that big fuzzball for me. (slugs Aang's arm, who winces and rubs it painfully) "
33,The Drill,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=213," I was, but something stopped me. Something big. That.  (looking determined) I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever's in charge.  Not needed? The question is, how are we gonna stop that thing? You're the idea guy. (looking out a window at the Drill below) We'll take it down from the inside.  Where are we gonna get something like that (Sokka abruptly draws his machete and chops off asteam valve) What are you doing! Someone's gonna hear us!  (sitting down to rest) I don't know how many more of those I have in me.  (suddenly inspired) Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give 100% of your energy into any one strike. (levitates to hisfeet) Sokka, take a fighting stance.You've gotta be quick and accurate. (hooks a foot around one of Sokka's ankles, pulling him off balance) Hit a series of points, and break your opponent's stance.(hits Sokka with a series of pretend blows) And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow. (bonks him lightly on the head) His own weight becomes his downfall. Literally. (A he finishes speaking, Sokka collapses >forward comically.)  (pointing upward) Then I'll go to the top of this thing, and deliver the final blow.  (passionately) Everyone inside that wall, the whole world, is counting on us.  That's enough, we need to get to the next one! (narrowly avoiding a second blast) Whoa! Guys get out of here, I know what I need to do. (heads other direction with Momo)  (pausing) This looks like a good spot Momo. (glances up, and barely avoids the large boulder that bounces off where he was standing) Aggh!  (shouting upward) General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here! (winded) What I'd give to be a metal bender.  Momo, get out of here!  (scratchingMomo's head) Thanks Momo, I owe you one. Now all I need is a... (boulder crashes down startling him) Actually, that is what I needed for once.  I kinda like that one."," Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa? And also the complaining guy. His Chi is blocked. (dissipates the energies) Who did this to you?  (lookingaway thoughtfully) Ty Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and it's weak points. It's like she takes you down from the inside.  Yes?  They come to fix it.  (appearing behind him) Hi. (crossing arms) What's this we stuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work. (explodes with frustration) Grrrrrr! (shoots a menacing glare back at Sokka, who stands  wide-eyed, arms still in air)  (clearlyexhausted) At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall.  This is bad, really bad. So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cut all the way through. Wait! You need this water more than I do!  (as Sokka struggles with hatch) Slurry pipeline What does that mean?  (fiercely) Why don't you try blocking my chi now circus freak! (stands resolutely with one hand upraised)  (losing temper) You know, I am just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day. You're like a chattering Hog-Monkey! Toph, help me plug up this drain! (slightly annoyed) Enough with the Team Avatar stuff. No matter how many times you say it, it's not gonna catch on.  Let's talk about this on our way into the city.  Sokka."," (as platform ascends) Now what's so big that Appa has to wait? (thoughtfully) That's a good group name, very catchy. (slaps general hard on the face) Get a hold of yourself man! Why are you all looking at me?  (complaining) So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan? That's a lot of pressure.  That part I don't mind.  (an idea suddenly hits him and he begins gesturingwildly Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo!  (excitedly) What you just said, that's how we're gonna take down the Drill. The same way Ty Lee took down all these big earthbenders.  It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing.  Sorry. (pointing ahead and upwards) There!  (peeking out upside down from the opening) Toph, Come on!  Okay, good luck. (both he and Aang disappear up into the Drill)  (studying the pipes) I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like. Then we can find it's weak points.  (confidently) That's the point. I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it, and when something breaks... (runs up and takes plans) This'll work, thanks!  (studying cross-diagram of Drill) It looks like the Drill is made up of two main structures. There's the inner mechanism, where we are now, and the outer shell. (traces his finger along diagram while speaking) The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse. (studying plans) Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.  (turns and gestures to self) Look, I'm the plan guy, You two (makes rapid chop-chop gestures) are the ""cut stuff up with waterbending"" guys. (strikes a heroic pose) Together, we're Team Avatar!  (pumping arms in the air) C'mon team, don't quit now, we're...  I mean, (recovers and points reassuringly) you're almost there.  Do you hear that We took it down. We better get out of here fast!  (grimacing) C'mon brace, budge! Were putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long! (raising arms) And boom, it all comes crashing down! (sweeps arms down)  The whole world, minus the Fire Nation that is.  (Encouragingly) Good work Team Avatar. Now Aang just needs to... (glances up) DUCK!  (smiles vacantly and waves) Hey.  (finally opening hatch, peering into it with Katara) It's rock and water mixed together, it means our way out.  Katara, keep that up. The pressure will build up in the drill, then when Aang delivers the final blow, it will be ready to pop! (in lecturing tone) Good technique little sister! Keep it up! Don't forget to breathe! (screaming) Just bend the slurry woman!! (enthusiastically) I just want to say, good effort out there today Team Avatar.  How about... (whips out boomerang, startling Momo) the ""Boomerang Squad!"", see it's good cause it's got ""Aang"" in it. (puts hand on Aang's head  Boomer-Aang. The ""Aang Gang""?  The ""Fearsome Foursome""? (now alone) Why? We're fearsome! "," (snatching his papers from Iroh disgustedly) I'm gonna forget I saw that.  Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang.

For a wise old man, that was a pretty stupid move."," (condescendingly) Oh, I'm sure it is War Minister Qin. But just to be on the safe side...

I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live. Can we see the King now?  If we are going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa.  If someone wanted to sell a stolen animal without anyone knowing, where would they go? You mean Platypus-Bear? Gopher-Bear?  Yeah, I'm mastering every element. How hard could manners be (grabs a nearby curtain and drapes it around himself like a noble's robe, and begins talking in a very sophisticated manner) Good evening, Mr. Sokka Watertribe. Ms. Katara Watertribe. Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty, your Momo-ness. Ow! Earth! Wow, you look beautiful. Where are they?  Or, we could go in with these guys. Toph said we might pass as busboys. Where are Toph and Katara?  I don't know what he looks like.  (voice over) That could be anyone. You found us.  Sorry! No, don't shout.  Watch this everybody! Greetings your majesty.  This could be the most important thing he has ever heard. (defiantly) I'll tell them. I'll make sure everyone knows!"," Look, the inner wall. I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece. Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa. What's that wall for? Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city?  What's inside that wall? Get in trouble with who?  I've got it! I know how we're gonna see the Earth King! The King is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear.  (duly) No, it just says ""Bear"".  Just...""Bear"". The palace will be packed. We can sneak in with the crowd.  Why not? (hands on her hips)  Excuse me? I've got no manners? You're not exactly lady fancy fingers. We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate. Sir I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations. (whispering) She's blind. Do you think you could help us? Our family's inside and I'm sure they're very worried.  Nyah! Pssfft!! I'm Kwa mai, and this is Dung. (Toph frowns and tugs at a string hanging from Katara's headdress.) Ow! Um... I don't see 'em right now. But I'm sure we'll find them soon. Thanks for all your help. Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in, won't let us out of his sight.  So the King is just a figurehead. You can't keep the truth from all these people. They have to know. What happened to Joo Dee?"," Hey don't jinx it! We could still be attacked by some giant, exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp. I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us. He's a giant bison. Where could someone possibly hide him? Oh. What's the problem? It's amazing! Yes. We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King immediately. Augh! Maybe you missed what I said. We need to talk to the King about the war, it's important. Yeah, we met a Professor from Ba Sing Se University. He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is absolutely crucial for the King to hear! Is that woman deaf She only seems to hear every other word I say. And who are the mean looking guys in robes?  (stunned) A month! I think we'd enjoy it more if we weren't staying so long. Can't we see the King any sooner?  (agitated)Where's the black market? Who runs it? Come on, you know! (points an accusing finger at the owner)  Right. And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation?  (whispering) Hey, come with me. So Pao, what's goin' on with this city? Why is everyone here so scared to talk about the war? Certainly you mean his pet Skunk-Bear. Ah-Ha, but you learned it. You could teach us.

You know, ""royal"", flowing robe, fancy jewelry.  (sarcastically) Thanks for letting us in. What guy? Not until we see the King. (whispering)You keep their attention while I look for the King.  Aang, the Earth King.  Hey, let me go. Why won't you let us talk to the King? We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!

""One doesn't just pop in on the Earth King"" (mimicking Joo Dee).  Or his Armadillo-Bear. This place is weird.  (lying down) Won't work.  Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd would spot you from a mile away. You've got no manners.  I learned proper society behavior and chose to leave it. (throws the half eaten pastry off to the side) You never learned anything. And frankly, it's a little too late.  Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys. Don't talk to the commoners, Katara. First rule of society.  I think this will do. (irritated) Look, the Pangs and the Yum Soon Hans are waiting in there for us.

(Cut back to show them both walking together, Katara's face has make-up as well.) I'm glad, it's about time we did something fun together. Don't listen to them, let's just keep walking. Let's go Toph. Now that was funny. Those girls don't know what they're talking about. That's what I really admire about you, Toph. You're so strong and confident and self assured. And I know it doesn't matter, but... you're really pretty. Yeah. You are. (Laughs)  Ow!","  What's this? (His head resting on his hands, looking pleased) Ahh, poetry. I am so sorry. Something struck me in the rear. I just... wound up... here? (Looking annoyed, then ponders this for a second.) They call me Sokka, that is in the Water Tribe, (counting the next five syllables on his fingers as he says them) I am not an oaf. You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard. I calls it easy! Like I paddle my canoe, (Turns around and paddles his behind once) I'll paddle yours too! (Making different arm motions) Squish-squash, sling that slang. I'm always right back at ya, like my... (drawing and presenting his boomerang to her face) boomerang!

(Cut back to the pair, Zuko forces Iroh to turn around as he had turned to look. Iroh sports a grin on his face.) Didn't I say don't look! (Reeling back in surprise) What?! (Turning back to her) My name's Lee. My Uncle and I just moved here. It took my Uncle ten minutes to do my hair. It's ok. Nothing. (Shouting and pounding the table with his fist) She is not my girlfriend! (Trying to find something to say) You have... quite an appetite for a girl. Um, well, we've been traveling around for a long time.  We were uh, apart of this traveling circus. Yes. I juggled. Whoah! I haven't practiced for awhile. (He wipes the shards of pottery from his hair.)  Close your eyes and don't peek.  Ok. Now you can look. I brought you something. It's a coupon for a free cup of tea. (He takes a few steps away from her.) Don't thank me. It was my Uncle's idea. He thinks you're our most valuable customer. It's complicated. I have to go. It was nice.",,"  I'm ready. You call it dirt. I call it a healthy coating of earth. Do I have to? The Fancy Lady Day Spa? Sounds like my kinda place. Sure Katara, whatever you say. As long as they don't touch my feet. Arrrr! Rrrrr! Errrr! Hahaha! Well, that wasn't so bad. I'm not usually into that stuff, but I actually feel... girly. Thanks. No, no. That was a good one! ""Like your poodle-monkey""... Ha ha! You know what else is a good one? It's ok. One of the good things about being blind is I don't have to waste my time worrying about appearances. (Cut to her frowning face.) I don't care what I look like. I'm not looking for anyone's approval. I know who I am. (They stop walking, shot cuts back to show the both of them.)  (Smiling) I am? I'd return the compliment, but I have no idea what you look like. Thank you, Katara. (She punches her in the shoulder in a friendly way.) "

(red faced and steaming with frustration, shouting) WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RULES, AND WE'RE NOT ASKING PERMISSON!!

(slams door shut)  (glaring at the door) I don't care. From now on we do whatever it takes to find Appa. (turning from the leaflet back to Katara) Katara, we have to give him a chance. (beseechingly) Katara, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out.  There's nothing here. (stroking the clump of fur sadly) We missed him. (frantically catching up with him) What island?! Where's Appa?! (anxiously) We've gotta get to Whaletail Island. (turns to the others, where Sokka is reading a map) Where's Whaletail Island? (standing) I don't care. We have a chance to find Appa. We have to try. (cheerfully) Don't worry, on the way back, we'll be flying! (looking to her) I bet they have Appa here in the city. Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet. (turns back to Jet) Where did they take you? (Jet is seen sitting on a stool, his head hanging low)  We need to find a way to jog his real memories.  (peeved) A bad one. Long Feng is escaping!  (outraged) You do have Appa. Tell me where he is! (brandishing his staff) You're definitely not! (desperately) Jet, it's me Aang! You don't have to do this. Jet, I'm your friend! Look inside your heart! (Jet, gasping, seems conflicted) He can't make you do this! You're a Freedom Fighter. (sitting at his side) Don't be. Appa's gone. Long Feng beat us here.  I don't think it's gonna matter. What is it Momo?  Appa! (head pressed in his fur, crying) I missed you, buddy."," We found a printer to make our posters.

Tell it to some other girl, Jet!  Jet's back. (resolutely) We can't trust anything Jet says. (with a hostile tone) I don't care why he's here. Whatever the reason is, it can't be good. (bitterly) You're lying!  (shoulders sagging in resignation) Alright... (suddenly stabbing a finger at Jet) but we're not letting you out of out sight!  (angrily) If this is a trap...!

(turns her head the other direction)  (accusingly) I thought you said you didn't have your gang anymore? (aghast) The Dai Li?! That's impossible. The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot too. (annoyed) Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka. Close your eyes. Picture it. Maybe this will help.

We can take the train out to the wall, but then we'll have to walk. (thoughtfully) No, it's not. Toph can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth. Jet's been brainwashed.

(attempting charm) See, we're friends, your Earthiness. Over here. (effortlessly escaping his bonds, Aang raises up his arms, then allows them to be bound behind him again)  (approaching the throne) Well, sir, there is a war going on right now. For the past 100 years, in fact. The Dai  Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you. (accusingly) Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our Sky Bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes, he brain washed our friend! Right there! Appa bit him. Oh yeah. (Aaag vaults upward, to land in front of the departing King) If you come with us to the outer wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real! (under his breath) I wish it wasn't. It's still there! (earnestly) We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer. Its energy will give the fire benders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable.

There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a Guru. (Momo seems to study the scroll beside him)  (eagerly) No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State. (distraught) Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together. Now you want us to separate?  (smiling) Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple. Appa and I can drop you at Chameleon Bay to see your Dad. (softly) Katara, I need to tell you something.

Long Feng's probably warned the King that we're coming. Sorry! (winces at the soldiers cries of pain)  Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King.  (appealing) You have to trust us. (astonished) So you've never been outside the upper ring before? The Dai Li must have known we were coming and destroyed the evidence. (suddenly inspired) The wall! They'll never be able to cover that up in time! (sarcastically) Really Then perhaps you can explain why there's a Fire Nation insignia on your construction project. (gestures toward the drill, which bears the symbol clearly upon its back)  (unrolling and reading) It's a letter from your mom. You mom's here in the city, and she wants to see you. (Toph's face lights up in surprise)  (hopefully) Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance? (reading) A small fleet of water tribe ships...

Me too."," (confidently) Look, we escaped from the Dai Li, we got Appa back, I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll. We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we need the Earth King's support.  I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different. See, Aang's with me. (puts arm over smiling Aang's shoulder, flashing a wide grin) It's the whole reason we came here in the first place, we have to try.  That's probably the Dai Li searching for us. (turns to Katara) So? There it is. That whole thing is the palace. The Earth King's chambers should be in the center.

(soldiers continue to slide past) Sorry. In there. Toph, which way to the Earth King? (closing door behind him) Sorry, wrong door. Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere. A little warning next time! (rubs the back of his head as he rises) No, we're on your side. We're here to help. (confused) But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies. Uh, no, him. (nods his head toward Aang)  Wait, I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a Sky Bison, ask him to lift his robe. (smugly) Never met a Sky Bison , huh? Of course there is! Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place. (raises hands to his face in dismay) Oh, don't tell me.. (slumps, then recovers and flashes a thumbs-up) That's ok, still got my positive attitude. Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more. (rushing up) If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa.  It's a drill. A giant drill made by the Fire Nation, to break through your walls. (shouting after him mockingly) Looks like Long Feng is ""long gone""! Ha...Oh, yeah, I've been waitin' to use that one. (rubs a tear from one of his eyes)  (stepping forward) That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness. Because we think you can help us end the war. (Momo perches on the King's shoulder)  But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity. A solar eclipse is coming. The sun will be entirely blocked out by the moon, and the fire benders will be helpless.  (decisively) That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. The Day of Black Sun. You're already vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls. You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive, and give yourself a fighting chance.

(scratches the back of his head)  This is all such big news. Where do we even start? (resigned) Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion. I guess that's me?

The Kyoshi warriors are a skilled group of fighters, trust worthy too. They're good friends of ours. (embarrassed)Ahhh! Great! That's enough! Ok, we love each other.

(growing angrier) I don't?! How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through. Me personally (turns her back to Zuko and crouches down). The Fire Nation took my mother away from me. I'm sorry I yelled at you before. It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face.(regretfully) No, no, that's not what I meant. Maybe you could be free of it.  I have healing abilities. This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I have be saving it forsomething important. (walks up to Zukoand faces him) I don't know if it would work, but...Aang! Aang, I knew you would come. We've got to find Sokka and Toph. I thought you had changed!"," So, what kind of trouble is Katara in? It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time.  What is that?!  Need a ride?  Oooo! Aang, are you ok? See Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now, talking about make up or something. Oh no. Huh uh ! Woah there. You lost me at, ""Zuko"". Good inside of him isn't enough. Why don't you come back when it's outside him too, okay?  (angrily) My sister! Where are they keeping Katara? (points his machete at the Dai Li agent)  We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk...no offense. And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King about Azula's coup. There's General How! The coup is happening right now! We've got to warn the Earth King! Thank goodness we're in time! (sweating)  Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki. Nope. All clear.  Let's go!"," (cheerfully) It sure is Uncle. What's taking so long?  Something's not right.  (standing to his feet) Azula! No. I'm tired of running. It's time I faced Azula! (angry and determined) Yes! I challenge you! You don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry. That's something we have in common. It doesn't matter. My face. I see (turns away and places a hand to his scar). It's ok. I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.  What? It's a scar. It can't be healed. (upset) Uncle, I don't understand. What are you doing with the Avatar!! (points a finger at Aang)  (hurt) Why Uncle?  Release him immediately! I have changed. (regretfully)  I betrayed Uncle. But I don't have the Avatar. What if Father doesn't restore my honor?"," The Earth King and The Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you, and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death. (Cut to a close up of a Dai Li lowering his head in anxiety. Azula steps down from the pedestal and comes closer to the agents.) The coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King, and each of the five generals, must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you in me command while we overthrow the government. (Azula walks toward a Dai Li agent with a scar on his cheek and look him in the eyes.) If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, I will snuff it out. That is all.  There are still a few loose ends. The Avatar, and my brother and Uncle. (mockingly) It's tea time. Have you met the Dai Li? They're Earthbenders, but they have a killer instinct that is so Firebender, I just love it! (examining her nails and speaking in a bored tone) I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, Uncle. You're so dramatic. What, are you going to do, challenge me to an Agni Kai? (smiling mockingly)  No thanks.This fight... is over. Get them all out of my sight. It's because they haven't made up their minds. They're waiting to see how this is going to end. I can see your whole history in your eyes. You were born with nothing. So you had to struggle and connive and claw your way to power. But true power...the divine right to rule...is something you're born with. The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne and which one is going to be bowing down. But I know. And you know. (Long Feng begins to sweat. His face is full of hesitation and uncertainty. Azula sits on the Earth King's throne and crosses her legs.)  Well?Don't flatter yourself. You were never even a player. I expected this kind of treachery from Uncle, but Zuko, Prince Zuko...you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?It's not too late for you Zuko. You can still redeem yourself. Why don't you let him decide, Uncle? I need you Zuko. I've plotted every move of this day. This glorious day in Fire Nation history. And the only way we win is together. At the end of this day, you will have your honor back. You will have your father's love. You will have everything you want.  You are free to choose. We've done it Zuko. It's taken a hundred years, but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se. No, he betrayed you. Zuko, when you return home, father will welcome you as a war hero. He doesn't need to Zuko. Today, you restored your own honor."," Ahhh! So how did it go with the Guru? Did you master the Avatar State? There's no one else here. Wait, someone's at the door. (points back at the door. A moment later, someone knocks on it.) Actually, I know who it is. It's an old friend of mine. (Toph walks to the door and slides it open to reveal Iroh.)  Glad to see you're okay. I met him in the woods once and knocked him down. Then he gave me tea and very good advice. Well whaddya know. There is an ancient city down there, but it's deep. They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors! See any Dai Li agents near by? That is a nice trick."
41,The Awakening,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=301," (clutching his stomach) What happened?  Oh no! (confused) Momo? Are you sure? (rubs his eyes) I feel like I'm dreaming. (Aang is caught off guard when Katara runs up and embraces him.)  (confused) Sokka? Ughh. (off screen) Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the only one out of it? (shocked and feeling his scalp) I have hair? How long was I out? Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda (offers his hand). Are you mad at your dad or something? Mmm-emmm (shrugs, but almost immediately groans and holds his side in pain).  A little higher.  Wow, you are definitely in the right area there. I went down! I didn't just get hurt, did I? It was worse than that. I was gone. But you brought me back. You saved me. So, what now? Me? The world thinks I'm dead? How is that good news? That's terrible! No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea. This is so messed up!  I'll handle this. The Avatar is back!  (whispering) I hate not being able to do anything. I can't just stand by and do nothing!(Aang rushes outside.)  Fine! Well, I am pretty hungry. Maybe dinner's a good idea. I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly.  You're right, I don't. But the problem is, I did fail. It is true. I was in Ba Sing Se. I was there, but I lost. And now, the Earth Kingdom has fallen for good.  (angry) And I hate the invasion plan, too! I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes. (grabs the tapestry above his bed and rips it off its hanger, throwing it to the floor and knocking over his staff) I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord, but now, I know I need to do it alone. Katara, please. Just go, please. I need to redeem myself. I need my honor back. Blockade. I'm not gonna make it. I failed. Roku? But everyone thinks I am dead again. They think I've abandoned them, and I'm losing this war. I'm letting the whole world down.  I don't know. You're right. I won't give up. I have so much to do.  What about the invasion? That's okay. If someone saw it, it would give away my identity. It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive."," Aang, you're awake! You're not dreaming. You're finally awake. (Katara lets go and the person dressed as a Fire Nation soldier walks up to Aang and gives him a quick hug.)  You need to take it easy, o.k? You got hurt pretty bad. I like your hair. A few weeks. (looking away) We're fine, Dad. (annoyed) He knows who you are. I just called you ""Dad"", didn't I? (annoyed) Great, great. Now you guys have finally met, so would you mind giving us a little privacy? What? Not at all, why would you say that? Maybe we should go upstairs. You need a healing session. Tell me where your pain feels most intense. (Aang's eyes are squeezed shut and he gives a soft grunt of pain.)  I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there. Let me just see if I can... I just used the spirit water from the North Pole. I don't know what I did, exactly.  (places a hand on Aang's cheek) You need to rest. (annoyed) It's Sokka's invasion plan. Aang, wait. Remember, they don't know we're not Fire Nation. This is water from the Spirit Oasis, at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important. I'm gonna give us some cover!  You guys go ahead without us. We'll catch up with you. I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much. (places a hand on Aang's shoulder The camera tilts up to Katara) You don't want people to think you failed. Aang, that's not true. Remember, there's still an invasion plan. Aang. Is there anything you need?  I brought you some food.  Oh no! He left.  (frustrated)Aang. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone. That it's all his responsibility.  (angry) It's not brave. It's selfish and stupid. We could be helping him. And I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much that we need him too? How could he just leave us behind? (crying) How could you leave us, Dad? I mean, I know we had Gran Gran, and she loved us, but...but we were just so lost without you. (crying)I understand why you left. I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way? I was so sad and angry, and hurt. You're ok! I know, but you'll have our help."," Aang, good to see you back with the living, buddy. After what happened in Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety.  (voice over) We flew back to  Chameleon Bay, where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men.  (voice over) The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone.  (voice over) Well, not completely alone.  (voice over) Soon, the bay was overrun with Fire Nation ships. Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise.  (off screen) Since then, we've been traveling west (points to Chameleon Bay and moves his finger across The Serpent's Pass). We crossed through The Serpent's Pass a few days ago. We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us.  So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke. And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage. (whispering) We have a secret (looks left and right). You! Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead! (stands up and raises his arms triumphantly) Isn't that great?! No, it's great. It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore. And even better, they won't expect you on The Day of Black Sun. Aang! No!  You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret. Just let us handle this. Things couldn't get much worse. The Universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it? Thank you, The Universe! (pulls out a red headband) Here, tie this around your head. It'll cover your arrow. Aang, be practical. We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force on the day of the eclipse. "," I've got a lot on my mind. It's been so long. Over three years since I was home. I wonder what's changed. I wonder how I've changed. I haven't seen Dad yet. I haven't seen him in three years, since I was banished. So, I didn't capture the Avatar. No. There's no way he could've survived. What did you hear? Why'd you do it? Why did you tell Father That I was the one who killed the Avatar? (sternly) It can't But why?  You're lying. You have another motive for doing this. I just haven't figure out what it is."," You seem so downcast. Has Mai gotten to you already? Though actually, Mai has been in a strangely good mood lately.  So what? (gesturing) Who cares? The Avatar's dead. Unless you think he somehow miraculously survived. Well, then I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. (eyes closed) You're going to have to be a little more specific. Can't this wait until morning? (Sighs, opens her eyes and sits up) Fine. You seemed so worried about how father would treat you because you hadn't captured the Avatar. I figured, if I gave you the credit, you'd have nothing to worry about. (gets out of bed)  Call it a generous gesture. I wanted to thank you for your help, and I was happy to share the glory.  (walks past Zuko) If you say so.  Please, Zuko. What ulterior motive could I have? What could I possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the Avatar? Unless somehow, the Avatar was actually alive. All that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness. But you said yourself that was impossible. Sleep well, Zuzu."," (off screen) Twinkle-Toes, that's got to be you. Uh-oh! Somebody catch him, he's gonna... Hopefully, you won't need to. They know! Load the Toph! How we doing?You make it so easy! Hey, Aang, we're going into town to find some dinner. You didn't think you could get out of training just by coming to the Fire Nation, did you? Hey, what's... (grabs Aang's broken and burnt glider from out of the water) Oh...it's your glider."
42,The Headband,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=302," I think I see a cave below. Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. If we get Fire Nation disguises, we'll be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave. I don't know about this. These clothes belong to somebody. But if it's essential to our survival...then I call the suit! Uh...your mom's necklace. I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or as they say in the Fire Nation - ""Stay flamin'""! (He saunters out, the kids following. A man is eating a meat shish kebab on the sidewalk. Aang waves to him as they walk by.) Greetings, my good Hotman! Oh, we're going to a meat place? (unconvinced) You guys go ahead. I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Heh, heh. Uh!  That's right. (He knocks himself on the head to indicate its lack of contents.) Let the molding begin. (relieved) Yeah, the colonies. Of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom. Sorry ma'am. Um, I have a scar. It's really embarrassing. (chuckling) Just ""Slob"" is fine. (This doesn't go over well. He tries a different tack.) Or, uh... Kuzon. We made it through the day, Momo. And...it was pretty fun! (concealing Momo and turning around with an innocent grin on his face) What monkey? (amiably)Wow. (He bows, Fire Nation style.) You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about. It was nice meeting you. (modestly) I guess I'm just lucky. I'd love to! (covered in burn marks) I got invited to play with some kids after school. (happily) I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow. Every minute I'm in that classroom. I'm learning new things about the fire nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai.  (deviously) I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow... Flamey-o, Hotman! (He runs off in excitement.)  Fire Lord...forefathers... (desperately) Firebenders...Fire Lord...blah, blah, blah, blah. (rising) Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush. (thinking better of it and sitting down) I'll just write down my best guess. (stops playing) I know. I'm a terrible Tsungi hornist. I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right? But what about expressing yourself? Thanks, On Ji. I could show it to you again, if you'd like. I'm not ready to leave. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the time. Listen, guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we wanna change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom. I'm gonna throw them...(he does a quick tap dance flourish ...a secret dance party! Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork. (approaching Appa) Sorry, buddy. You should probably wait out back. (Appa grumbles and shuffles into a tunnel at the back of the cave.) I know, you've got fancier feet than anybody...and six of 'em! Ladies and gentlemen, The Flamey-os! Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving. This is when you start dancing. Oh, boy. Listen, guys...dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you. Sure you do. You have for generations. It just so happens that I know several classic fire nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as ""The Phoenix Flight."" And this was the ""Camelephant Strut"". And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se. Yeah, that's it. That's the sound of happy feet. All right, go with that. Everybody freestyle! Don't worry about them. It's just you and me right now. Uh-oh. I don't know. It was just a dance party, that's all."," Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes.I call the silk robe! (She leaps from the rocks, runs to her prize and snatches it from the line.) (partially visible in the right side of the screen, from behind) How do I look? Where have you been? We've been worried sick! (shrugging her shoulders) Mmm-mm? Sapphire Fire, nice to meet you. My goodness! That doesn't sound like our Kuzon. I don't know, Aang. These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I'm not sure that I know how to... Okay.  Aang, everyone's watching. We're safe, Sokka. You can take off the moustache, now. Well, that was some dance party, Aang."," Shhush... keep quiet! (The cloud disperses with a blast of airbending to reveal the kids, riding Appa. Sokka dismounts and begins a furtive reconnaissance.) Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud who knows how to keep its mouth shut. Hey! We're in enemy territory. Those are enemy birds.  Well, this is it. This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins. Hiding in cave after cave...after cave...after cave... (His head drops further to his chest with each repetition of the word.) (to Momo) Looks like we got out voted, sport. (To the kids) Let's get some new clothes. (standing up, flummoxed) After what? Enrolled in what?! Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea. But it sounds...really terrible. Impressive, I admit. But I still think it's too dangerous.  Hmm... I am a fan of secret rivers. (relenting) Fine, let's stay a few more days. (turning to Katara) Flamey-o?? Fire! Wang Fire. This is my wife, Sapphire. Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce. (He blusters in Aang's face.) Young man, as soon as we get home, you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime! That settles it. No more school for you young man! What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters? (pointing) Go to your room! (arranging candles) I can't believe we're having a dance party. It seems so... silly. Wow, they look pretty good together. (smugly) Oh, no, I can't. It's permanently glued to my skin. (He strokes it, unaccountably pleased with himself.)  (rocking lazily back and forth and clapping his hands slowly like a tranced-out beatnik) Flamey-o, sir. Flame-ee-o."," (in a tone of insolent menace) I'm going in for a visit. You're gonna stand guard here, and no one is going to know about this. Uncle. It's me. (standing at the bars) You brought this on yourself, you know. We could have returned together. You could have been a hero! (Iroh turns a shade further away from Zuko.) You have no right to judge me Uncle. I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me. (Iroh is silent.) You're not gonna say anything? (Enraged, he kicks a stool and bends a blast of fire at the wall.) Argh! You're a crazy old man! You're crazy, and if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter! (snickering) You're so beautiful when you hate the world. I don't hate you, too. (They kiss.)  Can't you see we're busy? (He and Mai resume their ""business"".)  (standing, incensed) That guard told you.  (sitting back down) Okay, you caught me. What is it that you want, Azula? I brought you some komodo-chicken. I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food. (Iroh, sitting down, is silent, his back to his nephew.) I admit it. I have everything I always wanted, but it's not at all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice. (He clenches the bars.) I think the Avatar is still alive. I know he's out there. I'm losing my mind. (desperately) Please, Uncle, I'm so confused! I need your help. (Iroh is motionless. Zuko stands, enraged.) Forget it! I'll solve this myself! Waste away in here for all I care! You're sure you weren't followed? (Cut to a side view. Zuko is speaking to an ominous looking figure twice his height.) I've heard about you. They say you're good at what you do. And even better at keeping secrets. The Avatar's alive. I want you to find him. (Cut to a close-up of Zuko's face.) And end him."," (off-screen) Ahem! (The two lovers look up at her in irritation.) Zuko, could I have a word with you? (not to be put off) Oh, Mai... Ty Lee needs your help untangling her braid. So...I hear you've been to visit your Uncle Fatso in the (smugly) No, you did. Just now. (solicitiously) Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I'm looking out for you. If people find out you've been to see Uncle, they'll think you're plotting with him. Just be careful, dum-dum."," (sarcastically) Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in. Plus...they have real food out there. Does anyone wanna sit in the dirt and eat cave-hoppers? (She punches the cave wall and several hoppers hop out. Momo catches one and begins chowing down. The kids appear revolted.)  Hmm...I should probably wear shoes, but then I won't be able to see as well. Sorry shoes! (Sitting down, she brings her knee up to her chest, pulling on the shoe's upper and popping out the sole with her foot, which propels it into Sokka's face. She stands up and evaluates her new customized footwear.) Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender. Yeah, we got our outfits. What do you need to go to school for? (mockingly) Ha, ha. They're coming! Everyone stop bending! Who knew Twinkletoes could dance?   (Katara smiles.  Way to go, Dancypants. I think you really did help those kids. You taught them to be free."
43,The Painted Lady,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=303," (playing hide-and-go-seek) Momo! (He ducks underwater before Momo sees him, resurfacing nearby.) Oh Momo! (He ducks again, surfaces again, and the lemur finally spots him.) Ah! Ha ha, you found me, buddy. (It seems to finally dawn on Aang that he is swimming in toxic filth. He airbends himself up into the saddle.) Hey guys, I think this river's polluted. Hey, maybe we can get food there. Now you look just like a little hill with horns. Bye buddy! Thanks for the ride!Let's just get what we need and go. But we just saw you. You're even wearing the same clothes. The only difference is your hat.I don't get it. What?  What's the matter, Katara?  He doesn't look sick. You okay, buddy? (He pulls Appa's tongue out.) His tongue is purple! That can't be good. Katara, can you heal him?  Yeah, are the people...happier?  Is that why this place seems so festive? Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like...(He does an elaborate dance to one-up Sokka) Woooooo.... Wooooooo..... What's the matter, buddy? (He spots Katara just as she is slipping out of sight.) It's her! (He runs after her.) Hello, Painted Lady spirit! (Katara, shocked, begins running away, but she is only barely able to keep ahead of a determined airbender.) Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule. Wait, but I'm the great bridge between your world and mine. I know Hei Bai, we're close personal friends. (He chases her across the landscape, over the river and into the village. Running along a rooftop, he shouts to her...) Heeeyy!!My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar. Yeah, me too. I hate that. (He takes a peek under her hat brim.) You know, you're really pretty for a spirit. I don't get to meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet...not very attractive. (suspiciously)You seem familiar, too. No...you really seem familiar. Katara ! You're the Painted Lady ! But how? So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait...is Appa even sick  I can't believe you lied to everyone so you could help these people.No, I think it's great! You're like a secret hero. You want to destroy this factory? (triumphantly) Ha ha! (He imitates the sound of an explosion.)  Hey, I just found out this morning.Fire Nation soldiers are heading to the village. (overcome) He really does have a heart, doesn't he? Aha, I knew it! I knew you were the same guy. You're the shop owner and the boat guy. (exasperated) No, I just saw you! You switched hats and called yourself a different name!"," It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food. (A long scroll of paper unrolls in front of her.) Assuming that'll fit into Sokka's master schedule. We're, um, from the Earth Kingdom colonies. Why do you guys live on the river?  Look at this place. It's so sad. We have to do something to help. These people are starving, but you turn your back on them?! How can you be so cold and heartless?  (relunctantly) I guess so. (sadly, giving him a fish) I wish I could spare more.Forty-three minutes? No way. I think Appa's sick. It looks like he needs some medicine. Maybe we can find the right herbs in town. The Painted who now?Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest. Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady? I mean... spirit? (indignantly) Why would you say that? Look how much better off these people are. (in a ridiculous fake voice, and attempting to hide her face) Well, hello, Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy. (chuckling nervously) Thank you, but... A lot of people say that. Look, I really should get going... (defeated) Hi, Aang.I wasn't at first, I was just trying to help the village. But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway...I guess I just kind of became her. He...might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but, other than that, he's fine. I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have. Well, if you want to help...there's one more thing I have to do.Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently. Shhh, we don't want to wake Sokka. (It is a little late for this; Sokka and Toph are waiting for the pair as they walk into camp. Katara is all innocence.) Hi! Sokka! We were just...out on a...morning walk! (guiltily) I...kind of destroyed their factory.It was your idea! Well, what was I supposed to do? (dramatic close-up) No. I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me. (She gets up to leave.) I'm going down to the village, and I am gonna do whatever I can. I thought you didn't want to help.Sokka. You really do have a heart. (They hug.)  Leave this village and never come back. Sokka, it's okay. (to the villagers) I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real. You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself. So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean?"," (fishing pole in hand) Well, that explains why I can't catch a fish around here. Because normally my fishing skills are... off the hook! Get it? Like a fishing hook?  Hm...it's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today! It's in the middle of the river!No, we can't waste our time here! We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on. These people are on their own! I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic! We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord! (a little quieter) Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come first. Hey, Dock. You work here too?  We'll just take the fish. Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore? Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule. It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track. Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day. Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse - which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes. And we just lost a whole day. So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early! Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks. I got it, how's this From now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time.  Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient. Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning. What, Appa's sick? That's awful! Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now. (The rest of the gang gives him the evil eye and he quickly changes his tune, rushing solicitously to Appa's side.) And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well. Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today?  See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them. All we need is medicine for our sick friend. (exasperated) I guess you're right. You got any more food to sell? (mulling it over briefly) Two-headed! (The kids are revolted.) What? You get more for your money that way. Hi, Dock. Is Xu around?  (the eternal skeptic) And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along. Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was. Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory. (He makes gestures to indicate explosive spirit magic.) Oooooo... pow. Wooooooo..... Oh, really? A morning walk? (He dumps the dry grass from her sleeping bag onto the ground.) I know you're the Painted Lady. I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and feeding him purplizing tongue berries! (Toph sticks out her now-purple tongue and holds up a bag of berries as evidence.) Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now. (He turns to Aang.) And how long did you know about this? (to Katara, angrily) What did you do?!You what?! I was joking. I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises. Did you even think this through? The army's gonna blame the villagers. They're headed there right now to get revenge. Leave! Do nothing! Wait. I'm coming too. You need me, and I will never turn my back on you. Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you. Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone. You should be down on your knees thanking her. You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?",,," Too bad your skills aren't on the hook. (Toph's sally is more successful; the kids laugh, except Sokka, who scowls.)  I don't feel anything. Where is this village?  (slapping her hand over Sokka's mouth) Hey, loudmouth! Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about taking out theFire Lord. (sarcastically) Finagle away, O schedule master.Well,I'm not waking up early.  Forget it. Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much. He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water.Is it just me, or does this place seem different? We need more food. Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better. What's going on?  Maybe we can clean the river."
44,Sokka's Master,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=304," Not if we can stop it.  Toph, let's make a trench to keep the fire from coming any closer.   Keep an eye on Momo (Momo flies to Sokka and lands on his head.)  (bending the water around) Sokka, stand clear. (dusting his hands off) Good work, everybody. These people have no idea how close they were to getting toasted last night.  Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time I mean, look at Katara's hair, right (grabs a lock of Katara's hair and gestures to it) What's up with that?  (apologetic) Nothing, I was just trying to... (off screen) What do you think? (cut to a titlingup shot of Aang wearing an extremely stylized and complex suit of heavy, shiny armor) Pretty slick, huh? (cut to a close up of an alarmed Katara) All I need to complete the outfit is a wind sword.    It's where I get a sword handle. And then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade. (Aang raises a sword handle a swings it around, making wind noises.)  I'll just stick to what I got. That's it. That's what you needed all along, Sokka.     Not the sword...a master. (Sokka pulls the sword off the rack) We've all had masters to help us get better. You should see if you can study with Piandao.   What should we do today?  Twice?        (jokingly) How hot is it?  I guess the jokes don't run in the family.   (pointing at a different spot) No, we're over on this island.  Sokka!      Say something funny.    How did you know?    The white lotus. Hm.         "," Wow, this is amazing to watch.       The fire is gonna destroy that town.      There's a creek over here. I'll bend the water on to the fire. (Katara whips Appa's reigns and flies off.)  What's your problem? You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug.      That's not true. No one can read a map like you. (embarrassed) What? What's wrong with my hair? (Katara looks left and right nervously, trying to cover her hair.)  (sits down next to Sokka) I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I hope you know none of us see you that way. (pauses a moment, then places a hand on Sokka's shoulder) I know something that's gonna make you feel better.   (shielding her eyes from the shine of the armor) What's a wind sword?   Yeah...nice. That's a great idea. I could've never gotten to where I am without Master Pakku. Everyone needs a teacher.  Sokka's been in charge of the schedule. I'm not sure what we should be doing. It's so hot, it's so hot... Momo is shedding like Appa. (petsMomo and flicks tufts of fur from her fingers) Huh, huh? Oh, everyone's a critic. So where are we going next? (pointing to the map) We're starting from here.   Ooh, I got one. If you miss him so much, why don't you marry him? We missed you so much.  But why would you agree to train someone from the Water Tribe?   What does it mean?    You know, I don't think there's such a thing as ""space earth."" If it's from space, then it's not really earth. I can't believe I missed you.","  Kind of makes you realize how insignificant we are.     Oh, man. You've never notseen anything like this.  (dejectedly) What should I do?    So what, I'm just a lemur-sitter (petting Momo's head) There, there. Feel better? (disappointedly) Right, stand clear. Got it. (off screen, sarcastically) Boo-hoo, poor heroes. It's just...all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around, and making other stuff fly around. I can't fly around, ok (sadly) I can't do anything.    Look, I appreciate the effort, but the fact is each of you is so amazing and so special, and I'm not. I'm just the guy in the group who's regular. (depressed) You do?  (clapping his hands excitedly) Shopping!  Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling. (pulls a nunchaku from the rack) Hey, how about these (begins twirling the nunchaku) Ho-ya! Smack-a-dacka-doo! Ooo. (walks to the sword, closely examining it and feeling the scabbard) That's what Sokka's talking about.      A sword?      (pulls out the sword and examines the blade) It would be nice to be a master swordfighter. All right, I'll talk to him. I've come to train with The Master.     Well, uh... (feels around his clothes for something to offer)  Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword.   (nervously) Oh, uh, really? Uh, where I come from, The Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name, for Fire Nation colonials.    Well, actually, I've been all over the world.      And I know one thing for sure, (gets down on his knees and hangs his head) I have a lot to learn.    I know. Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth. But the truth is...I don't know if I am worthy.  Like a second head.      (skeptical) Writing my name will make me a better swordsman? I am? (looks at the brush) I am. So this is about putting my identity on the page, right? I'm finished.    (worried) Is that ok?       Hm, manipulate them to my advantage. Oh! Hey, would you mind grabbing a cold drink for me? I have? But I thought I messed up every single thing we worked on. (excited) Are you giving me one of yours? Master, would it be possible for me to leave and bring back a special material for my sword? Hey, guys. What are you doing?      Funny how? What's their deal?       Thanks. That warms my heart. Anyway, I need some help.  Oh, these are my friends. Just other good Fire Nation folks. (Piandao bows to them) Do you think we can make a sword out of a meteorite? I'm sorry, Master. You're wrong. I am not worthy. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not from the Fire Nation. I'm from the Southern Water Tribe. (Aang, Katara, and Toph all gawk at Sokka with shock and disbelief) I lied so that I could learn swordsmanship from you. I'm sorry. No, this is my fight, alone. It's a Pai Sho tile.       I have no idea. (Fat is seen in the background closing the doors. Sokka and Aang look back and the camera zooms in on the doors, clearly showing a lotus design on the doors surrounding the Fire Nation symbol) Ooh, that reminds me. Toph, I thought you might like this since you've probably never had a chance to bend space earth before. Must you ruin everything?",,," Eh, you've seen nothing once, you've seen it 1,000 times.    (eating a dumpling) Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is we don't get the hero worship anymore. I miss the love. I can't read at all.    I learned from badger moles. They don't talk, but they're still good teachers. I'm tapped out. I already picked my toes, twice. The first time was for cleaning, but the second time's just for the sweet picking sensation. (picking her nose) Plus, it's so hot today.     I don't know. Real hot?            (lying down) You noodle-brains don't know what you're doing. I miss Sokka.      Sokka's coming! You're back.      I don't know. They missed you or something. I didn't care. (turns away, blushing and smiling)  Sweet. Check this out.    "

(The camera pans over to reveal more of the rock water slide and Aang whizzing through it. Cut to close shot of Aang still riding the water slide tunnel and laughing. Cut to outside shot of a Fire Nation Officer 1 lounging on some rocks, fanning himself, while Fire Nation Officer 2 uses his sword handle to clean between his toes in the foreground.) (to Momo) Let's go again! (Momo looks hesitant. Aang air bends out of the water springing back up the rocks. The telescope-like camera follows his springing motion up the cliff till he disappears over the other side. Cut to shot of the two Fire Nation Officers huddled cheek-to-cheek, sharing one telescope and shaking with fear. They duck back down and face one another.)  (Aang crawls forward) We can. Jump on Appa. I'll try to (out of breath) I'm ok. (Momo jumps on to Aang's back) ", (turning toward Toph) There are walls all around us. It's completely safe. I don't think so. I get the feeling he knows who we are. (looks at Aang) , This is crazy! How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?," Doing nothing is a waste of time. (Zuko stands up) We're being sent away on a forced vacation. (Zuko walks over to the balustrade, leans on it and stares out to sea) I feel like a child. That was a long time ago. It smells like old lady in here. Here... (Bringing the shell toward her) This is for you. I saw it and I thought it was pretty. Don't girls like stuff like this? (throws the shell away in anger) Forget it! (Close shot of the two of them) I thought since it's so hot... Here. (He hands her an ice cream cone, but the scoop of ice cream falls off the cone into Mai's lap)  Why didn't you tell those guys who we were? (cut to shot of Zuko and Mai walking side by side) Pft. He thinks he's so great. (to Mai) Well, what do you think of him? (they stop walking)  You like him, don't you?  I know. So what? Sure. (gets up and walks away)  (Shot of Zuko yelling angrily at the boy who accidentally knocked the plate) Hey, watch it! That food was for my cranky girlfriend. (Points in the direction of Mai)  (close-up shot of Zuko, angry) Stop talking to my girlfriend! What's wrong with me?! Well, at least I feel something...as opposed to you. You have no passion for anything. (raising his arms is the air) You're just a big ""blah"". (close- up shot of Zuko) I was just leaving. Those summers we spent here seem so long ago. So much has changed. (close shot of Zuko) Where's your new boyfriend? (Mai turns away angrily. Zuko comes and sits next to her) Are you cold? (he puts his arm around her, but she slaps it away)  (close shot of Zuko smiling) I'll make a fire. (The camera pans upward toward the cliffside and then the mansion) There's plenty of stuff to burn in there. What does it look like I'm doing?  You think I care? You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business! (He turns away from her)  No, you don't. (he waves his arm angrily) You're stuck in your little Ty Lee world, where everything's great all the time. (mocking) 'I'm so pretty, look at me. I can walk on my hands, whoo!' (Zuko does a hand stand. Cut to shot of Ty Lee looking sad. Cut back to Zuko who is upside down. He lets himself fall to the sand) Circus freak! Yeah, you don't believe in anything. I'm sorry, too. I wish you would be high-strung and crazy for once, (Close shot of Mai looking away and Zuko standing over her) instead of keeping all your feelings bottled up inside. She just called your aura dingy. Are you gonna take that? I like it when you express yourself. (he reaches for her, but she backs away)  My life hasn't been that easy, either, Mai. (Mai interrupts him)  (angrily) Bad skin? (Ty Lee cringes. Cut to shot of Zuko looking toward her) Normal teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury. My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my face. (Zuko points toward his scar)  For so long, I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home, now my dad talks to me. Huh, he even thinks I'm a hero. (cut to Azula, who smiles at these words) Everything should be perfect, right (cut to over-head wide shot of the four teens sitting around the fire) I should be happy now, but I'm not. I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why. No one, (he looks down) I'm just angry. Everyone... (he covers his ears in frustration) I don't know. No, no! No, no... No, no.(yells suddenly) I'm angry at myself!  Because I'm confused. Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore. I guess you wouldn't understand, (pulls Mai to him) would you, Azula (sarcastically) Because you're just so perfect. Party's over."," Lighten up. So dad wants to meet with his advisors alone... without anyone else around. Don't take it personally. (turns toward Ty Lee) We used to come every summer when we were kids. (cut to wide shot of the beach, Azula stands looking at the game, Mai and Ty Lee sit under the umbrella behind her. In the background Ty Lee is being fanned and worshipped by three Fire Nation Teen Boys) Hey, beach bums, we're playing next. (The camera zooms in on Ty Lee) Ty Lee, get over here now!  See that girl with the silly pigtails? (Azula and the others look up toward the volleyball players, cut to shot of a pig tailed Fire Nation Teen girl kicking the ball around) When she runs towards the ball, there's just the slightest hesitation of her left foot. I'm willing to bet a childhood (Cut to close shot of Azula through the volley ball net, which is on fire. She looks sinister. The camera zooms closer and closer) Yes, we defeated you for all time! You will never rise from the ashes of your shame and humiliation! (Cut to Azula standing with her team, she turns casually toward them) Well, that was fun. What about me and my brother? (Crossing her arms in displeasure) Aren't you going to invite us? (cut to shot of Ruon Jian and Chan, who look at one another skeptically) You don't know who we are, do you? We'll do our best. I guess I was intrigued. (Cut to shot of Azula sitting next to Ty Lee) I'm so used to people worshipping us. Yes, I know, and I love it! But for once, I just wanted to see how people would treat us if they didn't know who we were.  I heard you telling someone you'd be partying from dusk till dawn. (looks out at the horizon) It's dusk so we're here. We are the perfect party guests. We arrive right on time because we are very punctual. (Azula makes a chopping motion with her left hand, hitting her right hand as she says 'punctual')  That's a sharp outfit, Chan...careful, (close shot of Azula, looking intense and somewhat crazy) you could puncture the hull of an Empire-Class Fire Nation Battleship, leaving thousands to drown at sea... (Azula points at his outfit) because it's so sharp. Come on, Ty Lee, you can't be this ignorant. (Cut back to Azula, leaning coolly against a wooden beam)  Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them. You're not a challenge. You're a tease. It's not like they actually care who you are. (Cut to Ty Lee, bursting into tears. She covers her eyes. Cut to wider shot which includes Azula, who grabs Ty Lee's hands in a comforting gesture) Ok, ok, calm down. I didn't mean what I said. (Close shot of Azula) Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little... (whispers) jealous. (turns away from Ty Lee) Well, you're right about all (Looks down) Well, that sounds really shallow and stupid. (Looks up grinning) Let's try it. (laughs loud and unnaturally, drawing the attention of everyone at the party)   Chan, I'm ready for a tour of the house. No, I used to come here years ago. Your arms look so strong. Together, you and I will (camera rotates right as Azula quicklystands and raises her arms toward the sky) be the strongest couple in the I thought I'd find you here. (she gestures down the steps) Come down to the beach with me. (she starts down the steps) Come on, this place is depressing. (laughs)  Here we go. Well, that's it, then. (close-up shot on Azula) You had a controlling mother who had certain expectations, and if you strayed from them you were shut down. That's why you're afraid to care about anything, and why you can't express yourself. There's a simple question you need to answer then. (sheleans forward) Who are you angry at?  Is it Dad?  Me? (sternly) Answer the question, Zuko. Come on, answer it. Why?  You're pathetic. (still clapping slowly) Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone. Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care. (Cut to shot of the burning embers left from the fire) My own mother...(cut to shot of the embers reflected in Azula's eyes) thought I was a monster. (cut to Mai and Zuko. Then to Ty Lee, who looks on concerned. Cut back to a wide shot of the whole group, Azula sitting in the center of the shot) She was right, of course, but it still hurt. You know what would make this trip We've got some bad news, Chan.

Cover up! I know...it's your tattoos (raises arms in frustration) I'm worried about. What if someone sees you? Guys, you're all gonna think I'm crazy, but it feels like a metal man is coming.

(off camera) Who's... wait, that's me, isn't it? (calls out) Roku? Roku? No, that's wrong. I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all. Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil. Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance. And I also think it was about friendships.

Wait. I need to ask you something. What do you remember about our Great-Grandfather's history? (confused) But how did he die? (frustrated) What does it mean? (Annoyed, he tosses the scroll aside. It lands on his bedside lantern. The light from within the lantern shines through the parchment. It reveals a secret message on the scroll. Zuko gasps and grabs the scroll from atop the lantern. He reads aloud.) The Fire Sages keep the secret history in the Dragon Bone Catacombs.  (reading aloud) The final testament of Fire Lord Sozin. (disappointed) That can't be it, where's the rest of it?  (shouting) You sent this, didn't you? I found the secret history. Which, by the way should be renamed ""the history most people already know."" The note said that I needed to know about my great-grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end.

It slowly pans up from the bottom of the painting. It rest's on Sozin's face, a comet arching in flight over his head. Azula continues to tell Zuko Sozin's history.) Fire Lord Sozin began the war, of course. He spent his early years secretly preparing for it, but he was as patient as he was clever. He famously waited for the comet, later renamed Sozin's comet, and used its power to launch his full-scale invasion of the world. (The camera angle changes. The siblings are shown, standing side by side, looking up at the painting, Azula finishes the story.) In the end, he died a very old and successful man. Didn't you pay any attention in school, Zuko?

Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud. Uh, guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me. Yes! Yeah! So, guys, what are we gonna get with our last silver piece? Flamey-o, Toph! Toph got us money. She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like. Katara, I'll personally make you an Avatar promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams. Wow, how does it work? (digging nervously at his eye) Well, I... (chastened) Yes, ma'am. Sure. I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas. I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write. I guess plan B is, we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara. Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long?  Where do you think anyone is?  (Combustion Man appears on a rooftop, just above the boys.  As he draws in his breath preparatory to firebending at them, Aang hears the intake of breath and, looking upward, spots him.) Sokka, watch out!

I believe we've had enough training for today. (startled) Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff?  Ah, so she cheated. I'm just saying, this isn't something we should make a habit of doing. (indignantly) I don't hate fun. (She seizes Momo and drapes him on top of her head.) See? Fun.  Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough. If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen. Oh, I'm sorry. You think I should be more like you? Like some wild child? Ah, I see. You're acting like this because of your parents. They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents don't exist. You act like you hate them, but you don't. You just feel guilty. I don't think so. I think you miss them. But you just don't want to deal with that, so instead, you act like this crazy person. You know what? It doesn't matter. These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that. We've already got some third-eyed freak after us. We have enough money. You need to stop this! Sokka, tell me you didn't buy a bird. Well, look who decided to join us. Where have you two been? Off scamming again? And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all? Really? Well then, what's this? It's a wanted poster of you. ""The Runaway"". Is that what you're called now? Are you proud of this? It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is... Your stuff was messy, and I was just straightening up and I happened to stumble across it. Fine! It's a lie. But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up. I knew you were hiding something, and you were. (Toph knocks the poster from Katara's hand and walks away.) Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you! I wish I could. I never said I was!

I was gonna say... I want to pull a scam with you! Not just any scam...the ultimate scam! (The boys collapse, stupefied.) What do you say, Toph? Just me and you... one last go. You in? The plan is simple. This wanted poster says you're worth a lot of money. (Cut to Fire Fountain Village, presumably the next day. The scene from the beginning of the episode replays, with Katara's plan as a voice-over.) Ten times more than you've made in all your scams. So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way. You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. (sanctimoniously) The right thing is its own reward. (disconcerted) But... I still want the actual reward. Really? No kidding. Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap? I can't believe I was so stupid. See, this is exactly why I'm against these scams. I knew this would happen. I know. I wanted to show you that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too. I know your relationship with your parents is complicated, and I shouldn't have said what I said. What are we gonna do? What about your meteor bracelet? You could make a saw. Just fine. I'm making my own water! Aang, get up! What is it, Toph? I'll be happy to help."," Yaaaaaah, sneak attack! Yes! Yeah! Look at all those messenger hawks. You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone... I could just send them messages! She used earthbending to win the game. Classic! Speaking of that third-eyed freak... I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you think of...""Sparky-Sparky Boom Man""! (The gaang are unimpressed.) Just think about it. Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some. See you guys later (Cut to Fire FountainVillage, where Sokka hasjust fulfilled his dream and bought himself a messenger hawk.) Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner. And as such, I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't want to see any fighting. (He pokes the hawk affectionately and coos baby-talk at it.) Good wittle messenger Hawky. Who's got pwetty feathers? (He walks by a wanted poster of Toph, and does a double-take.) You're right, Hawky. This is bad. Toph, when I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like. It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you ""The Runaway."" Well, yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. But Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us. Well, that is true. I had this idea of making armor for Appa. I do like expensive atlases. Not just a bird. A messenger bird! Now we can send messages all over the world, even to Gran-Gran. Hm, uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky Gran-Gran, South Pole. (He points helpfully. Hawky shakes his head in confusion.) I think he gets it. (Momo appears over Aang's shoulder and dashes at his new rival. They wheel furiously about Sokka's head as he tries to calm them.) Hawky, make nice! Bad Hawky! Hey - I'm staying out of this one. I know, Hawky. Why can't they just get along?Hey, Aang, you want to test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea. I'm gonna send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again. Eh, it's a gift. (He takes pen and paper and composes a missive.) Dear Katara. Sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph. Yep, we're idiots.  I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help. (He walks over to Toph.) Come on, we need to talk. Nah, she's pretty much a pain. (Katara scowls.) She's always got to be right about everything, and she gets all bossy, and involved, and in your business. Actually, in a way, I rely on it. When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara, she had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom. I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly, I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like, my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there, and now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture. Hey, my lips are sealed. I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out.  (Leaving, he admonishes Hawky and Momo.)  You two behave. Appa's in charge.  Where do you think they might be?  You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit. This guy is too good. He shoots fire from his brain! Hey, I got it. The perfect name for that guy! ""Combustion Man""! See? It fits so well.  Well, I'm exhausted. Hawky, how about you, buddy? (affectionately) Yeah, you're such a lazy little bird. Hey, where'd Hawky go?",,," How could you do this to me? You betrayed me! Good job, twinkle-toes. Visualize - then attack! (obnoxiously) What's the matter? Can't handle some dirt, Madame Fussy Britches? Hungry for a mud pie? (derisively) While Katara cleans up, let's go have some fun! (jokingly) I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you. We can get more money. Right there. (She points to a street below, where a con man is fleecing a crowd of Fire Nation citizens with a shell game.) This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage. Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute. But I can feel it with my earthbending. How could I possibly play? I'm blind. More interesting? How?  I'll do it for forty silver pieces. I won! Hey, I only cheated because he was cheating. I cheated a cheater. What's wrong with that? Why? Because its fun, and you hate fun? Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up?  Yeah, maybe. Maybe then, you'd see how great we have it. I mean, look at us. We're traveling around the world, making easy money, having fun, with no parents to tell us what to do. (dismissively) Whatever. I do hate them! Look. I ran away to help Aang! I'll stop when I want to stop, and not when you tell me! Well, it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the sheet of paper. (enthused) A wanted poster. That's so great. ""The Runaway"". I love my new nickname. Is there a picture of me? Does it look good? Don't be such a worrywart like your sister. Think of it this way. Now you have plenty of money to help with the invasion plan! Here's a little extra so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation. You know what? Make it an atlas. Of course you do. And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret. Yes, we were. No, I don't. Yes, really. (exasperated) I don't know! I mean, seriously, what's with you people I'm blind! Where did you get that?! You went through my stuff! You had no right. That's a lie! You're lying, Katara. Oh, really, Mom? Or what are you going to do? Send me to my room? Well, you can't. Because you're not my mom, and you're not their mom. No, but you certainly act like it. You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not. You're just a regular kid like the rest of us, so stop acting like you can tell me what to do. I can do whatever I want! I can't be around you right now! So let me guess. You brought me out here to tell me your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be. Yeah, I don't know how you can deal with it. I don't understand. I guess I never thought about that. The truth is, sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom. (Katara lowers her head, in sadness or perhaps shame.)  Don't ever tell her I said any of this. Katara, stop. You don't need to apologize. I was the one being stupid. These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them. What? You want to pull a scam? You know I'm in! Now what's this idea of yours? How could you do this to me? You betrayed me. (alarmed) Hey, what kind of cell is this? Wait. It's a trap! Not for us, Katara. We're the bait. He wants Aang. But...this was your idea.  Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with.  It's ok. I was really mad when you said that because; well, because maybe it's true. I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them. I don't know! I wish we had some earth or water. We need bendables! I left it back at camp. I was worried they would take it. (Katara wipes sweat from her forehead... and has an idea. She stands up and begins running in place. Toph is understandably puzzled.) Um, Katara...are you ok? Well, what are you doing? Katara, you're a genius! A sweaty, stinky genius! Let's get out of here. Good job, Sokka. Now let's get out of here before ""Combustion Man"" catches us! Katara, I need your help. I need you to write some things down for me. I want to send a letter to my parents."
48,The Puppetmaster,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=308," I think I liked ""the man with a sword for a hand"" better. All right, now I'm getting scared. I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad. Helping people...that's what I do.She could be home any minute. Ok, that's pretty creepy. We shouldn't be doing this. (nervous) Guys, I don't know about this. (grimaces in utter disgust) Great. I'd steer clear of the ""sea prunes"". Close enough. This has gotta be the nicest, natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here. Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people? (off screen) Old Man Ding? Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you? I didn't know that spirits made prisons like this, who brought you here? We have to stop Hama! Give up, you're outnumbered. This feels weird. (off screen) It's ok."," No, wait, I've got one, and this is a true Southern Water Tribe story. No, it happened to Mom. (everyone focuses their attention on her) One winter, when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom realized she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home, just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice, (little girl's voice) ""It's so cold and I can't get warm."" Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue, like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but... when every one came back, Nini was gone. No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day. But sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm. You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories. Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn. That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages. That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. She kind of reminds me of Gran-Gran. (sarcastically) Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids, camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious? Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? You can't just snoop around someone's house. (nervous) Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble, and this is just plain rude. (closes the doors) So... she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. Sokka, you've looked enough. Hama will be back soon. (angry) Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff. Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room. This is crazy, I'm leaving. You're from the Southern Water Tribe? How did you know? I knew I felt a bond with you right away. You're a Waterbender! I've never met another Waterbender from our tribe. We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid. I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor, you're a hero. (excitedly) Yes, yes of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me. I know, when we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do. I've even used my own sweat for waterbending. Wow, these flowers are beautiful. I met a Waterbender who lived in a swamp, and could control the vines by bending the water inside. That was incredible. (stares down at the flowers sadly) It's a shame about the lilies, though. But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon. (uneasy) But, to reach inside someone and control them? I don't know if I want that kind of power. I know. It's you. You're the one who's making people disappear during the full moons. (defiant) I won't! I won't use bloodbending, and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town. Stop...please. You're not the only one who draws power from the moon. My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me! I'm sorry, Aang. No!"," Suddenly, they heard something down the hall, in the dark. Oooh... It came into the torchlight. And they knew the blade of Wing - Fun was haunted! Aah-ah... Is this one of those ""a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to"" stories? Where'd she go?  Pft, nice try. Yes, please. What do you mean, disappearing? I know Momo, this place is creepy. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep. People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff during full moons... this just reeks of spirit world shenanigans. And then you can sew up this little mystery, lickety-split, Avatar-style. This is a mysterious little town you have here (looks right into Hama's face).  That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something. But what did she mean by that comment, ""mysterious children""? I'm gonna take a look around. It'll be fine. I'm not finished yet. [grunts] Come on... Just an ordinary, puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Then why does she have a locked door up here? We'll see. (peers in through the keyhole. Cut to his perspective. The camera zooms in on a small chest, sitting in the light shining through the attic window) It's empty except for a little chest. I have to see what's in there. Maybe there's a key here somewhere. Come on, come on! Suit yourself. Do it, Toph. (disbelief) An old comb? But why didn't you tell us? And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right. (Katara punches him in the arm) But I'm sorry we were sneaking around. So how did you end up out here? How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation? (furious) The moon spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and... lunar goodness. (takes the hammer and nail and proceeds to nail the board down) We wanted to ask you about that.  Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain? I can't see anything down there. A witch, what do you mean? (angry) Hama! I knew there was something creepy about her.  We know what you've been doing, Hama! Katara, look out! It's like my brain has a mind of its own. Stop it, arm, stop it!",,," Water Tribe slumber parties must stink. Wait. Guys, did you hear that? I hear people under the mountain, and they're screaming. No, I'm serious, I hear something. It just stopped. (excitedly) Maybe it's treasure. Oh, hand it over.  This isn't as easy it looks. I thought they were ocean kumquats. Maybe the moon spirit just turned mean. Where does Old Man Ding live? Oh, no! (she startles Aang and Sokka) I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there. I can hear them, they're this way. This is the place. (takes Sokka's hand) That's why you have me, let's go. I'll get these people out of here, you go."
49,Nightmares and Daydreams,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=309," (shocked) Wait, (shoots out of bed and high into the air) four days! (close up of Aang's horrified face) The invasion's in four days!  Uh.. (looks around frantically but everyone seems to be asleep) I guess. (continually making a series of comically fast and dramatic ninja-like moves during this speech) Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord. I'm bringing you down! (cut to shot of Aang waking up startled) Uah! (Aang feels all around to make sure he is wearing pants, and then sighs with relief. Momo approaches him) It was just a dream Momo, I still have my pants. (cut to wide ground shot of Aang getting up) Well, I better keep training. A couple hours. (Aang circles the tree, doing some fancy footwork and varying the type of punches) I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm going to fight Ozai. You don't get it, do you? (Aang circles Katara, who looks half frightened half amused, as Aang does a variety of air punches and defensive maneuvers) My form is bad. I'm sloppy. And I still don't know any firebending, not even the basics.  Okay, (raises his arms and then begins a series of comic and sloppy attempts at chops, punches and kicks) well, I still have to work on everything else. I'd better spend the whole day training. (wide shot of the group on the cliffside) Good night Katara. Good night Sokka. Good night Toph. Good night Appa. Good night Momo. Good night Appa and Momo. (He points coolly) Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord. I'm bringing you down... and this time I brought pants. (The camera pans down to reveal the chains are meant to lock on the pants)  (close shot of Aang in a panic) Math test?! Oh no! (he turns toward the camera) I forgot all about the math test! (Aang falls through the air yelling, and is crushed between the giant abacus beads. He wakes up startled, sweat dripping from his brow.) I've got to be ready! (ground level shot of Aang looking wild and still concentrated on the Koala-Sheep) But I forgot my pants and my math test. Sokka get up! I need to know what day it is! (Aang pulls on Sokka's eyelids and lips in a comedic fashion.)  (cut to Aang hopping around the sleepy Sokka, tugging on various limbs) Sokka, you've got to get up and drill your rock climbing exercises. (cut to close shot of Aang, looking unfocused and tired. He makes overly large comedic gestures during his speech and often looks confused) In one of my dreams, you were running from fire nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, but you (cut to close shot of Sokka looking disgruntled) were too slow and they got you. (Sokka springs up to stand before Aang)  (points upward) Then climb that cliff. Climb it fast!  (Yells, causing Sokka to startle and slip down the cliff face) Don't drink that! In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom. We died because of your tiny bladder. (Aangmimics holding his bladder) And you (addressing Katara) need to start wearing your hair up. (Aang gestures his hair and then starts pulling and stretching his forehead) In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and... You're right. I'm losing my mind.  It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, (Cut to shot of Aang twittering his fingers in a nervous fashion) I just end up more stressed. (Cut to wide shot of Aang pacing back and forth. His friends sit in the background. They are absorbed in their own tasks and seem to be ignoring Aang's ravings) I'm like a big, growing snowball of nerves. (cut to close up shot of Aang upside down. The camera spins and pans inward, in a dizzying motion) I feel...really warm. Like there's the warm feeling all around me. This heat... like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace, and he's shooting a bunch of fire balls at me. And the whole world is being engulfed in flames. (flames shoot across the scene and spiral inward. There is a flash. Cut to Aang rolling out of the yoga position and on to his back. Katara looks up and the tired and out of breath Aang)  (close aerial shot of Aang looking disgruntled) You know what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days. (The camera pans over a wider aerial shot of Aang, Sokka and the Koala-Sheep) You said it yourself. He's the baddest man on the planet. I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world. Okay, but what can I do to feel better? Pound away. (Toph begins to stomp her feet causing the pillars to pummel Aang) Ahh! Ow! Uh! Toph! (close shot of Aang in serious pain) I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me! (Toph stops and Aang falls off the bed of rock pillars)  (Aang looks at the porcupine, screams and runs away) Ahhhh! Thanks for everything guys. (close shot of Aang looking confused) Uhh...I kinda think I sorta might ... slightly feel a little better ... maybe. (Aang turns away from his friends and slumps over, bowing his head to the ground) It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse. (Aang looks up at him, disgusted and then turns around and speaks angrily) No, that won't help. Nothing helps. (close shot of Aang looking determined) There's only one thing I can do. I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion.  Invasion. All aboard for the invasion. (cut to close up shot of Aang turning towards Katara) I told you, I can't go back to sleep. Actually staying up all night has given me some time to think. (Aang walks toward the ocean, Katara follows him) And I've realized some big things Katara. (looking out into the sunset) I see everything so clearly now... what really matters. Why I'm really doing this. I'm doing it to save the world, (turns toward Katara) but more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love. (close up shot of Aang stepping right up to Katara) I'm doing it for you Katara. I'm saying...I love you.  What our hearts (lifts arms into the air in a grand gesture) have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby, (swings Katara on to her back and goes in for another kiss) you're my forever girl.  Huh? Oh, (straightens up and faces Katara) I guess I kinda drifted off into a day-dream. (looks embarrassed) Uhh, living under water?  (close up shot of Aang breathing a sigh of relief) Heh. Phew. Put 'em up, Fire Lord. (close up shot of Aang, his arm reached out in front of him at some imaginary enemy) Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach. (Aang jumps up into the air with a yell and beings to shoot balls of air down at the noodle Ozai. All 4 shots miss.) You think you're untouchable, don't you Mr. Fire Lord.  Momo, did you hear something. Uhh. (Aang bends in toward Momo looking very confused. Cut to close shot of Momo)  That's more like it. (pets Momo) I'm so tired, that for a second there I imagined you were talking to me. (Momo cocks his head to one side as if he is confused) Oh, Momo... let me explain. Uhh. (bows his head, frustrated, and then lifts his finger to make a point. Cut to wide scene of Aang talking to everyone. Appa is still standing there like a human) I appreciate what you guys are saying. But the stress and the nightmares, they were too much. Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it. Guys...come on. Oh, you don't like i?  Well let's go right now. Sokka, what should we do? About that! (turns toward Appa and Momo)  Come on guys, (cut to shot of Momo and Appa fighting with a ring of Koala-Sheep cheering around them. Aang stands outside the ring trying to get everyone's attention)  we're all on the same side! Huh? Huh! (yelling) I just need a jump in a cold waterfall.  Oh look, another hallucination. An imaginary bed, made out of clouds. Look, you guys keep telling me I need to sleep, but I can't, the invasion's tomorrow. (determined) No Katara, there's still so much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me. (raises his fists in a feeble attempt)  (close shot of Aang turning to Katara) You really think so? Thanks guys. (close shot of Aang smiling. He yawns and Katara helps him onto the fluffy Koala-Sheep wool bed.) You know what? I think I am ready. (standing on the ledge below the Fire Lord) Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord. (smiles slyly) No Fire Lord Ozai, (raises his sword) you're not wearing pants."," (cut to close-up ground level shot of the gang preparing for bed) Nice choice Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule. Sokka's got the right idea Aang. We're here, we're ready... (lays down on her mat) the best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest. Hey, how long have you been up? (close shot of Aang, very out of breath) You know there is such a thing as over-training. Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep. (Katara sighs, and then breathes in deeply, she moves forward and grabs Aang's shoulders. Aang's very bloodshot eyes turn toward her) Aang, sleep. Please...for me. (cut to Katara holding Aang's cheek) Aang, I know you're just trying to help. But you really need to get a grip. You're unraveling. Sokka, you're not helping! You know what? I've got just the thing. (places her arms on Aang's shoulders, smiling) Get ready to be ""de-stress-i-fied"". (Cut to wide shot of the outside of a steaming crater. Cut to shot of Aang and Katara standing beside the steaming water inside the crater) These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach up. (Aang and Katara reach upward) Reach for the sun. (Aang and Katara sway from side to side) Feel your chi paths clearing. (They bend over and touch their heads to the ground) Now close your eyes. How are you feeling?  Good, good. Go on. Maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out. (Cut to shot of Katara and the others looking toward Aang with smiles) So do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night sleep? (worried) What happened Aang? You don't look so good. (approaches Aang) You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap? Aang, staying up can't be good for you. (close up shot of Katara) What big things? Aang, what are you saying? What are we doing? Aang? I was just saying you should take a nap. What was your dream about? (looks skeptical, then smiles) Sounds neat. Aang (Aang and Momo look up in surprise. Cut to shot of Katara.) We're all starting to get a little worried about you. (imploringly) Aang... I'm not going to hit you. Listen to me, (grabs Aang's shoulder) you've been training for this since the day we've met. I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough."," (looking at a map) This is it, the official rendezvous point for the invasion force. Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on a map. It's (close shot of the inside of Sokka's mouth, which pan's out to reveal him yawning) Whatever. (nonchalant) That's like... four days from now. (lays back onto his mat) Let's just calm down, and ... (snore)  That's okay Aang. The eclipse will block all firebending anyway, you don't need to know any. (he looks toward Aang) Plus it's a stupid element. What?! (jumps up) Who's talking?! (Sokka thrusts forward with his sword, but hits a rock head-on before he can complete his swing. He falls back on to his sleeping mat, his body stiff, frozen in the swinging position)  What?  But that was just a dream, (points at Aang) I'm a great climber.  (annoyed) Stupid Avatar. Stupid cliff. Stupid dream! I can climb fast! Ahhh! (turning toward Aang) Of course you are. That's 'cause you've got to fight the Fire Lord, (extreme close shot of Aang's horrified face) the baddest man on the planet. And you better win, or we're all done for. (The camera pans left to reveal an angry Katara standing up and turning to Sokka)  (standing up) What? It's true. That's the deal, he knows it. (Katara pushes Sokka to a sitting position angrily)  (speaking in a mocking, old man sounding, psychiatric tone) Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you. Mhm. (nods and gestures toward Aang) Tell me more about this, 'Fire Lord.' Why are you so afraid of him? Hmm. (close shot of Sokka with his eyes closed and nodding deeply) Life does feel that way some times, doesn't it? (cut back to shot of Aang, now getting frustrated) Like we're all trying to save the world from evil. Want to try screaming into this pillow? (cut to shot of Sokka) Then our work here is done.  (cut to close shot of Sokka) Looks like it's time for... (he spins around and now dons the 'Wang Fire' beard) another therapy session. Hey, I'm trying to build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's your bison ... (camera pans right to Sokka) You've been awake too long. About what?  We made it for you. (the camera pans further right to reveal a herd of recently shaved and shivering Koala-Sheep.) A good night sleep will probably take the crazy away... we hope. (cut to Toph and Sokka. Sokka's arms open) We all do. You can do this. You're ready."," I'm just going to Mai's house, it's not far. Tell me, if you can have anything you wanted right now, what would it be? (cut to close up shot of Zuko and Mai) You know, being a prince and all, I might just be able to make that happen. Do you think (the guards turn towards the couple and bow) you can find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top. (Zuko sits up completely, surprised, and turns toward Mai, who is also surprised) War meeting? What are you talking about?  (closes his eyes and turns away) I guess I wasn't invited. So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh. And apparently I'm not welcome there. (close shot of Zuko, perturbed) Oh yeah? I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it. (close up on Zuko, questioning) Well, were you invited?  (annoyed) And I'm the Prince! Forget it, I'm not going.  I don't. (sighs)I know. (Zuko and Mai approach him) What?  (close up shot of Zuko and Mai. Mai is smiling) So, my dad wants me at the meeting? When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me. (cut to close up shot of Zuko)  My father had saved me a seat. He wanted me next to him. (cut to wider shot of Zuko and Mai walking) I was literally at his right hand. During the meeting, I was the perfect prince. (close up shot of Ozai's face in the picture) The son my father wanted. But I wasn't me. (close up shot of Zuko, he bows his head. Cut wide shot of them standing in the wide empty palace hallway.) "," Hello Zu-zu. If you've come for a royal hair combing, I'm afraid you'll have to wait. What do you mean? Of course you're welcome there. Oh Zuko, don't be so dramatic. I'm certain Dad wants you there. You probably weren't invited, because it's so obvious that you're supposed to be there. (close shot of Azula, looking smug) Of course. I'm the Princess. Exactly, so stop acting (gestures) like a paranoid child. (close up shot of Zuko looking annoyed) Just go to the meeting."," How did you pick this place? (yelling) Go to sleep already! (cut to Toph sitting up, Katara visible in the background) Relax, it's still two days before the invasion. (perturbed) Why, is it poisoned? (an annoyed Katara water bends the water off herself)  Alright, what you need is a good old fashioned back poundin' to relieve your stress. Sorry, I forgot you have baby skin. (close shot of Toph looking pensive) Well, there's one other thing we can try... (Toph stomps and a porcupine flies into her hand from a nearby bush. It uncurls and bears its needles. Toph gives a large grin) acupuncture! (camera pans right to Toph) And you're acting downright weird. Hey! It's real! We spent hours working on it. (eager)You want me to do it? You're the man, (points at Aang) Twinkle-toes."
50,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion",http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=310," (Momo scurries to his shoulder) Top of the morning, Momo! Like a baby mooselion. I'm ready (in an attacking position) to face the Fire Lord. I can't. When Azula shot me with lightning, my 7th chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the Universe. (walking towards Haruand giving an introduction) Toph, this is Haru. When we met him, his town was controlled by the Fire Nation. So we had to hide his earthbending. (Camera zooms out to reveal Aang admiring his new glider) A new glider! This is amazing. Oh well, I'm sure that will come in handy. We've been looking everywhere for you. The boats are ready to leave. What? Sokka, (walks up to him and places a hand on his shoulder) that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking and nobody's really good at that. Look, your moment of truth isn't going to be in front of some map. It's going to be out there, (points to the vast ocean in front of them) on the battlefield.  Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again.  So, this is it huh? I'm ready. (Sokka grasps his arm, wishing him luck. The gang and Momo gather around for a group hug.)  Katara, I. You go first. Everything is going to be different after today, isn't it?  (uncertain) What if... what if I don't come back? What did you know? It did come in handy. (Cut back to the shadow of him flying. Aang adds more speed and flies towards the Fire Nation capital.)  That's strange.  The Avatar is back!  Hello? (looks around and walks slowly towards the inner palace doors) Anyone home? No... (drops glider and kneels on the floor in shock.) No, no, (shakes head) NO! Fire Lord Ozai, (raises voice in anger) where are you?! (His voice reverberates slightly throughout the empty throne room. Camera zooms out to show the empty throne room again. Fade to white.) "," Sounds like you slept well. Oh no. Sokka, do you think the fog will delay the invasion? You made it Dad! Haru, (runs and embraces him) it's so good to see you. (quietly to Aang) Wow, he says beginning, he means beginning, beginning. (voiceover) I don't see any gates.  Aang, I. We've been through so many things together and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid (Cut to a shot of Aang blushing.) I found in the iceberg anymore. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you.  Yes, it is.  Aang, don't say that. Of course you'll... (Aang cuts off the conversation with a kiss, much to the surprise of Katara. They part and Katara blushes as she looks away sadly. Aang opens his glider and flies off as Katara watches him go.)  (snaps out of her dazed mood) What? Right, I'm on it.  Dad? How does that feel, Dad? You're hurt. Badly. You can't fight anymore.  I'm doing everything I can. (Cut to Sokka looking away before closing his eyes to make a decision.)  No offense Sokka but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands. Don't be crazy, Sokka. I still think you're crazy but I'm proud of you too. "," No, that is the invasion.  Were you able to locate everyone I told you to find? Was that a new invention? You're making peanut sauce bombs? Were you able to complete work on the plans I sent you? Good morning, everyone!  Uhm... So, as you know today we're invading the Fire Nation. I mean I know you know that. (laughs nervously) Because otherwise why else would you be here Anyway... (Clumsily drops more scrolls. He picks themup and places it on a board.) The Fire Lord's palace is here. (Points to the map) Uh no, uh wait, (flips to another map) uh wait (flips again), uh wait (flips for the final time). It's here (points to the correct map. Cut to a shot of Due, scratching his head and looking rather confused) and uh there's an eclipse today and Aang's going to fight the Fire Lord (he starts to panic) and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us and uhm... (Cut to Teo and The Mechanist who look bored.) I'm sorry, let me start at the beginning.  (rapidly) Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg. Now I didn't like Aang at first but I grew to love him over time. Then we went over to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then ...and then Aang's friend was a crazy old man and then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache (Camera pans out to reveal Hakoda approaching Sokka) and if you look in the front row you can see him... (still disappointed with himself) I messed up, Aang.  The invasion plan was my moment of truth. And I completely flopped it. I just fell apart. My Dad is. He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone. Like a real leader should.  You seem so confident about everything. How do you know we're going to win? Well, I just came up with the idea but The Mechanist did all the work.  Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar's alive?  (Cut to Katara looking into the sky and still blushing. The entrance to the submarine opens.) Katara, what are you doing? It's time to submerge. Dad, look out! (Looks up at a battlement and narrows his eyebrows) I've got an idea.  Dad!  Can't you heal him any faster?  I'll do it. No. (stands up) I'll lead the invasion force.  Maybe I am a little crazy but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano (looks at the volcano) by the time it does. Yip yip.  (raising his voice) Listen up everyone, (Cut to Teo looking at Sokka inside the tank) I want the tanks in wedge formation! (his arms open upin a V-shape) Warriors and benders in the middle. (Toph and the Earth Kingdom soldiers are seen moving into action.) We're taking that tower (points at it) and headed for the royal palace!  (grabs his sword and points toward the enemy) Charge! "," I'm sorry, Mai. (He walks towards Mai's bed and places a scroll on the pillow as the camera slowly zooms out.)  I know I made some bad choices. But today, I'm going to set things right. (He grabs his broadswords and backpack before looking at his Mother's portrait for one last time. He throws on his cloak and walks away.) ",," So what's your strategy for taking him down? Going to get your glow on (her fingers flutter in front of her eyes) and hit him (punches the air repeatedly) with a little Avatar State action?  You know what I just? heard Blah blah spiritual mumbo jumbo blah blah something about Space. No way. (Gets into a defensive stance) Is that...  (A pair of huge hands appear on screen and carries Toph up. Camera pans out to reveal The Hippo.)  (angrily) You guys here for a re-match? Sweet. (smiles)  (Cut to Toph who is holding her head down.) Yeah. Congratulations, Sokka. (Lifts her head up. There's a look of discomfort on her face.) You managed to invent a worst way of travel than flying.  (Cut to a close-up of Toph smiling.) I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, twinkle toes."
51,"The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse",http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=311," He wasn't home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned. It's over. The Fire Lord is probably long gone. Far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse. We can still do this. We can still win the day. I've got to try. Do you feel anything down there? Stay safe. We'll be back soon. How was that careful? Climb aboard and hold on tight. (suddenly smiles cheerfully) Thanks. I'm ready. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.  Where is he? Where is the Fire Lord?  I can't pin her down. She's too quick. Okay, so what do we do? Just ignore her?  (grabbing Sokka's shoulder) Sokka, she won't talk.  Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over but I can face the Fire Lord anyway. But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me.  I guess you guys are right. (off screen) They've got air power, but so do I! (opens his glider) I'm going to do what I can to slow them down.  Let's join the others. They're headed for the beach. They're going to destroy the submarines! Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. I'm going to make this up to you.  I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple."," Yeah... Is that... is that Aang? Wait. If they knew we were coming, it could all be a trap. Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure all of us get out of here safely.  We can wait here if you want. It's not over yet.  They're back! Appa, you and I can help too. We can't keep them all back. They're too many of them!  Why aren't they turning around to attack us again?  What? We can't leave you behind. We won't leave anyone behind.  We'll miss you Dad."," Dad! You're on your feet again. Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet. What? Please tell you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down? They knew. No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far. He would have a secret bunker. Somewhere he could go so it'll be safe during a siege but still be close enough to lead his nation. The Mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about 10 minutes until the full eclipse. 10 minutes to find the Fire Lord.  What do you think? You're the one who has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you. Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere? Sounds like a secret bunker to me. What would we do without you? Yeah, pretty much. We'll have to be fast but careful.  I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky. There's no floor! It's just a river of lava.  That's some door! I am so glad we added you to the group. Only 30 seconds until the total eclipse. (brandishes his sword) Stop wasting our time and give us the information. You're powerless right now so you're in no position to refuse.  Wait! Aang, Toph, stop attacking. (Aang, Toph, and Azula all stop running) Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight!  She's just baiting you again.  We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow. (spreading one arm wide over his head in a gesture of dismissal) Ignore! Where is Suki?! (angry) Where's Suki?! Answer me!  (hesitates, then turns back to Azula) Where are you keeping her?! I fell for it! I used up all our time.  (hopeless) And now it's too late.  No. I don't think that's a good idea.  (putting a hand on Aang's shoulder) You'll have another chance. I know you will. It was all a trap. Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move. (he and Toph jump down from Appa)We just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.  Everyone, let's get back to the subs!  Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs. How are we all going to escape? Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win!  They're at the beach already! Bye Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise."," I'm ready to face you.  I'm here to tell the truth.  First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.  Because the Avatar is not dead. He survived.  In fact, he probably is leading this invasion. He could be on us right now.  That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore.  Think again! I am going to speak my mind and you are going to listen.  For so long, all I wanted was you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor that I wanted but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn. (points a sword at Ozai) My father, who challenged me; a 13-year-old boy to an Agni Kai. How can you possibly justify a duel with a child?  It was cruel! And it was wrong.  No, I've learnt everything! And I had to learn it on my own. Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history and somehow, the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation! They don't see our greatness, they hate us! And we deserve it. We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself, we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness. (closes his eyes for a second) Yes. He has.  After I leave here today, I'm going to free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm going to beg for his forgiveness. He is the one who has been a real father to me.  But I've come to an even more important decision. (pauses I'm going to join the Avatar. And I'm going to help him defeat you.  Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny. (sheathes his swords) Goodbye.  What happened that night?  (a tear streams from his eye) So she's alive. Uncle!  Where is my Uncle? "," So, you are alive after all.  I had a hunch that you survived. It doesn't matter, I've known about the invasion for months. (sarcastically) Hm, you mean I'm not good enough for you? You're hurting my feelings.  Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar. (her face becomes completely expressionless) I am a 400 foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings. When I left Ba Sing Se, I brought home some souvenirs. (two Dai Li agents drop from the ceiling and land in front of her) Dai Li agents. (sarcastically) Not true, I'm giving it my all.  Um, right. I think your friend just said that genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes.  It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you. (in a slightly bored tone) So, Sokka's your name right My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time. (Sokka stops and turns around) She was convinced that you were going to come rescue her. Of course, you never came and she gave up on you.  (under her breath, dripping with malice) Come and get it... Oh. Sounds like the firebending's back on.  Dad's all the way at the end of the hall and down the secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'll be more than happy to see you now.  No. They're too fast. It doesn't matter, they'll be back. "," If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, I'm just the girl to find it.  (her hand to the ground) Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano.  (she extends her hands to each side before plunging them into the ground, gripping the earth with her fingers) There's something big, dense, and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano.  This way! That one's a dead end. Perish and burn in hot magma. The tunnel continues on the other side and it leads right to the bunker. Not a problem.  And stick to the truth. I'll be able to tell if you're lying.  (after a brief pause) Okay you're good, I admit it. (bends the earth underneath Azula so that it encases her is a conical shape)  But you really ought to consider telling the truth anyway. You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time! (angry)I 'll roll your whole head! It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out.  The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go help our friends. "

(off screen) No, (Cut back to Aang with Sokka in the background) she's right, (Sokka looks up at Aang, stunned) we are here. Why can't I go? Fair enough. So, what's the new plan? (sarcastically) Oh, yeah, that's great. (He picks up a pebble and tosses it into the air nonchalantly) No problem, (He continues fidgeting) I'll just do that. (He lays the pebble on the bench and flicks it away.) (continuing his little tantrum) Well, it's not even gonna be possible. Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher? Yeah right, (He lies down on the bench without a care) like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again. Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we (He jumps over Sokka's bench) just take a nice tour (He proceeds to run off screen as Momo follows him) around the temple? (Cut to a close up of Aang as he feigns deaf) What? The wind is too loud in my ears. Check out this loop. Ok, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table. (Cut to a frontal shot of an excited Aang as the remainder of the Gaang descend from Appa behind him) Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber. There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done. (Cut back to Zuko who listens intently) We'll never let you join us. (Zuko's expression changes to surprise) (off screen) I kind of (Katara turns her head towards him) have a confession to make. (Cut to Aang's back) Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by (turns his body slightly so his side is facing the camera) Zhao? Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko (the siblings turn towards him) who came in and got me out. (Cut to a close up of Aang's face) He risked his life to save me. (Cut to a sideview of the 3 as Katara steps forward) You're probably right. Or when he tried to capture me (Cut back to Toph) at the fire temple. (Cut back to a frontal shot of the 3 again) I'm not having Zuko as my teacher. (He walks off screen and Toph's expression changes to surprise. Cut to a full view of the Gaang as Aang walks to an area behind Katara with his back towards them.) (shocked) You what!? So he attacked you? But he did firebend at you? (disappointed) I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice. I can't believe I'm saying this... but thanks Zuko. I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara. And after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. (he bows to Zuko) I'd like you to teach me. Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's ok with them. Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think? Sokka? Katara?"," This is humiliating. (She turns her head back) Both. (off screen) Uh, I think your feet need their eyes checked. You guys go... (Aang catches his glider and Katara lays a hand on his shoulder) I think we need to talk about some things. (Cut to a serious Katara) We need to decide what we're gonna do now. And since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this. Aang, no one said it's gonna be easy. (deep in thought) We could look for Jeong Jeong. Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now? You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are? (off screen) Or when you stole my mother's necklace (Cut to a sideview of the siblings) and used it to track us down (she takes a step forward with her fists clenched) and capture us? (off screen) You need to get out of here, now. (Cut to an angry Katara) No, we won't! (off screen) Get out of here (Zuko rolls himself onto his back and the camera pans up towards the Gaang) and don't come back. And if we ever see you again...Well, (Sokka takes a step towards Zuko) we'd better not see you again! Why would he try to fool us like that? (Katara starts walking into the chamber) This is just like when we were in prison together in Ba Sing Se. (Cut to a sideview of the 3 to show the siblings each holding a sleeping bag while Aang holds a jar) He starts talking about his mother, (Aang proceeds to walk off screen) and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings. (Cut to a back view of Sokka with his sister still in sight) The thing is, it worked. (kneels and sets the sleeping bag down) I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt. (looks around) But obviously when the time came, (stands up) he made his choice, and we paid the price. (Cut to a close up of Katara as she turns angry) We can't trust him. (off screen) Sokka, (Sokka turns towards his visibly annoyed sister as his uvula flaps around slightly) I looked at it and told you there was nothing there. No way, (brings her arms up and thrusts them to the side) I'm sure (punches her fists down) he only did it (crosses her arms) so he could capture you himself. And what was (punches her fists down again) all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? (crosses her arms once more) What a liar. You're right, (thrusts her arms down as Aang looks towards her) Toph, let's go find him (raises her arms up) and give him a medal. (She says this with sarcasm) The ""not as much of a jerk as you could have been"" award. (standing her ground) Easy for you to say, you weren't there (takes a step forward and points to the side) when he had us attacked by pirates. Why would you (brings her hands up and throws them down rapidly in hot anger) even try to defend him? Well, (crosses her arms) I guess that's settled. (passing the bowl to The Duke) Has anyone seen Toph? (worried) I think we should go look for her. Toph, what happened? (examining Toph's feet) Oh, no, what happened? I meant how. (shocked) Zuko? (cut to a close up of Toph's feet as Katara bends the water away and back into her water skin) It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better. I wish I could've worked on them sooner. You are a master of surprise, Sokka. I can't step out to waterbend at him without getting blown up. And I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here. I'll go along with whatever you think is right. (venomously) You might have everyone else here buying your ""transformation"". But you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past. (walks up to Zuko and leans forward threateningly) So let me tell you something right now. You make one step backward, one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang... and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. Because I'll make sure your destiny ends right then and there... permanently."," Do you mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation, (Katara turns her head towards her brother) or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple? I miss not having blisters (Cut to an overhead shot behind Appa) on my feet. Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan. You just need to master all four elements, and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes. There's got (brings up his hands to his chin and thinks) to be someone who can teach him firebending. (straining his voice against the rushing wind) Aang, (Appa continues to fly behind Aang) I think we should be making some plans about our future. (Cut back to a shot of the hour glass fountain as Aang and Appa land on the platform.) Not really, since you've followed us all over the world. Yeah, all you've ever done is try to hunt us down (Cut to a sideview shot of Zuko) and capture Aang. He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not (swipes his arm aside in a ""No"" gesture) buying it. (off screen) Like when you attacked our village? (interrupts) Wait, you sent (unsheathes his boomerang and holds it towards Zuko) Combustion Man after us? (off screen) Oh, sorry. (Cut back to a frontal shot of Toph and Sokka as he remains in a defensive position) I didn't mean to insult your friend. Either you leave, or we attack. Obviously, he wants to lead us into some kind of trap. He wants you (Katara turns towards him) to trust him and feel sorry for him, so you let your guard down, then he strikes. (punches his fist out) (Cut to an outraged Sokka) And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? (throws down his sleeping bag) I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month! (Cut back to a frontal shot of Sokka as he argues) I could feel it! It's my throatal flap. (Cut to outside the chamber looking in at the Gaang) Yeah, (steps towards Aang) face it Aang. You're nothing but a big prize to him. (Cut back to the siblings) Oh, hooray. (throws his arms up sarcastically) In a lifetime of evil, at least (brings his hands to his cheek and puts on a mocking friendly face) he didn't add animal cruelty to the list. (He brings his hands down and looks back at Toph angrily) (clenches his fist) Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island. You're darn right (Sokka takes a step towards his sister and it appears like a 3 versus 1 standoff) you're not, buddy. I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday. Oh, let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again. (shocked) Ugh! See, you trusted Zuko and you got burned... literally. Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him. He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him. Yeah... get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner. Then we'll jump him and really make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it. (thinks for a moment, then comes up with an idea) I know how to get an angle on him. All right buddy, don't fail me now. (jumps and catches the boomerang triumphantly) Yeah, boomerang! (he and Katara look up smiling, but quickly frown. Cut to a shot of Combustion Man standing back up and putting a hand to his forehead. Cut back to Sokka as he looks at his boomerang disappointedly) Aw, boomerang... Hey, and what about me? I did the boomerang thing. (gestures)  (closes his eyes and hangs his head a second, then shrugs) Hey, all I want is to defeat The Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then I'm all for it. So here you go, home sweet home. I guess, you know, for now. (cut to a shot looking through the window of Zuko inside the bare room and Sokka looking in through the door) Unpack... lunch soon. Uh...welcome aboard? (Zuko turns and smiles at Sokka. Cut to a close up of Sokka staring back before turning away.)Yeah. (cut to a shot outside the room as Sokka walks up to Aang) Ok, this is really, really weird."," The only view I'm interested in seeing (Iroh's expression changes into sadness) is the Avatar in chains. First, we'll check each of the air temples. (takes a few steps forward, looking around) Then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him. (turns around and raises his voice) What else would I expect to hear from the laziest man in the Fire Nation? (Cut to a close up of Iroh's slightly appalled face as he looks down and sighs) The only way (Cut back to a frontal shot of uncle and nephew) to regain my honor is to find the Avatar. So I will. Hello, (raises an arm in greeting) Zuko here. But I guess (rubs his hand against the back of his head nervously) you probably already know me... sort of. Uh...so, the thing is, (He puts his arm down and looks to the side hesitantly) I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm (places an arm on chest with pride) considered to be pretty good at it. (He continues smiling) Well, you've seen me... you know, when I was attacking you? (His eyes widen at his verbal mistake) Uh, yeah...I guess (places his fingers against his forehead in embarrassment) I should apologize for that. But anyway, (waves an arm to the side dismissively) I'm good now. (clenches both fists and places one on his chest while the other arm is raised) I mean, I thought I was good before, but now I realize I was bad. (He gets visibly uncomfortable and drops his arms into a slouch) Ugh, but anyway... I think it's time I joined your group, and taught (straightens up with a sincere expression on his face) the Avatar firebending. (Cut to a close up of a frustrated Zuko) Well, what's your answer?! Yeah, that's what I'd say too. (Cut to a far shot of Zuko's campsite as he raises his arm to his head in despair) How am I supposed to convince these people I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? (He proceeds to imitate Iroh's voice and pretends to hold an imaginary beard on his chin as he starts pacing.)  (Cut to a close up of Zuko's face) Hello, (raises his arm up in greeting) Zuko here. Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so I just thought (raises his shoulders) I'd wait for you here. I know you must be surprised to see me here. (Cut to a sideview shot of the Gaang as they wear hostile expressions on their faces) (Cut to a visibly uncomfortable Zuko) Right... Well, uh... anyway, what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I uh, (Cut to a slight overhead shot behind Zuko as the camera slowly pans upwards to show the Gaang) I'm good now. And, well, I think I should join your group.(Cut to a close up of Zuko's apprehensive face) Oh, and I can teach firebending... to you. (Cut to a confused Aang as he lowers his staff further. Cut to Katara in disbelief. Cut back to Zuko.) See, I uh... (defensive) I've done some good things. (walks forward) I mean, I could've stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free. (He thrusts both arms out towards Appa to prove his point) That's something. (Cut to a remorseful Zuko with Appa licking its lips in the background) I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes (looks to the side in shame) in the past. (Cut to a close up of his face) Look, I admit I've done some awful things. I was wrong (lowers his head down and presses a palm against his temple) to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe. (Camera pans across the Gaang who are still not pleased with his presence) And I never should've sent that Fire Nation assassin after you. (Sokka and Toph widen their eyes in shock) I'm gonna try to stop him. (Cut back to a slightly panicking Zuko) Well, that's not his name, but... (raising his voice) He's not my friend! (Cut back to Zuko who closes his eyes and opens them as he angles his head diagonally) Why aren't you saying anything? (Cut to Aang's back with Zuko still in view) You once said you thought we could be (Zuko shrugs) friends. (Aang looks down to the side, pondering) You know I (Cut to a frontal shot of Aang as he remains deep in thought) have good in me. (closes his eyes for a moment before opening them and staring back at the group with determination. Cut to back the slight overhead shot behind Zuko again.) I'm trying to explain (raises both arms in frustration and takes a few steps towards them) that I'm not that person anymore. (He continues to walk to the group but Sokka takes a step forward and thrusts his boomerang out as a warning. Zuko takes a step back.) (aghast) If you won't accept me as a friend, (Cut to a shot of the ground in front of Zuko as he kneels down with his head bowed) then maybe you'll take me (raises both arms out as if he was holding an offering but his fists are clenched) as a prisoner. Argh, I can't believe how stupid (thrusts both arms outwards as he exits the screen) I am. I mean, (walks back into screen) what was I thinking? (lays a head on his forehead as his expression turns into sheer despair and utter horror) Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula (thrusts his arm out behind him) did that? They (He brings his head towards the camera) would've believed that. Stupid! Who's there? (Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko as he sweeps his arm in an arc and firebends) Stay back. (Cut to Zuko as he gets off the ground) I'm sorry, it was a mistake! (proceeds to run off screen) Let me (his hands are in a pleading gesture) help you. (Toph sends a chunk of earth back as he dodges it) I'm sorry. (Cut to a frontal shot of an apologetic Zuko) I didn't know it was you. (He tries to move forward but holds his side and grimaces in pain. Cut to Zuko's back view as Toph is seen crawling away.) Come back! (Toph disappears into the darkness. Cut back to Zuko as he lies down and groans in frustration. Cut to an overhead shot of the campsite as Zuko brings up his hands to his head in despair, bends his knees and rolls slightly on his sides.) Why am I so bad at being good? (off screen) Stop! (cut to a shot of Zuko walking towards Combustion Man as he stands back up) I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore. The mission is off. I'm ordering you to stop! If you keep attacking, I won't pay you! (Combustion Man stops Zuko in his tracks by grabbing him by the shirt. Zuko throws his fireball, but misses and it hits the ground) All right, I'll pay you double to stop! (walking towards them) Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday. I've been through a lot in the past few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want now is to play my part in ending this war. And I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world. I'm sorry for what I did to you. (he bows to Toph) It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild. So as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending so I don't hurt people unintentionally. Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group. (excitedly) I won't let you down, I promise. If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar. I know it's my destiny to capture him.",," Hey, we're here. I can feel it. Wow, (Camera slowly pans down to rows of rocky protrusions) it's amazing. (Cut to a sideview of a confused Toph) Who's - Oh, (She folds her arms irritably) never mind. If it's important, I'll find out. (off screen) What's up with him? (Cut to the remaining 3) (Cut to a close up of Toph as she turns serious) I think that'll have to wait. (Cut to Toph as she interrupts Zuko. Sokka remains dumbfounded in the background) You want to what now?! (Camera pans down towards Katara and Sokka raises his fist in preparation for a fight) Appa (The siblings turn towards her) does seem to like him. (Brother and sister turn back angrily towards Zuko) (Cut to a visibly angry Toph) That guy (points an accusing finger at Zuko) locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us (swipes her hand down audibly) all up. (off screen)Actually, (The 3 of them turn towards her. Cut to Toph leaning nonchalantly against the door) he wasn't lying. (off screen) I'm just saying that (Cut back to Toph with an empathetic expression on her face) considering his messed-up family, and how he was raised, he could've turned out a lot worse. (Cut back to Aang and Katara) (Cut to a sideview of Toph with her arms crossed) All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere. Maybe (brings an arm up with her palm facing upwards) you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly. (Cut to a frontal shot of the 3) (Cut back to the blind bandit) Because Katara, (walks off screen) you're all ignoring (Cut to full view of the Gaang as Toph confronts them) one crucial fact. Aang needs (Cut to a sideview of Aang as Toph enters the screen and jabs a finger on his chest repeatedly to prove her point) a firebending teacher. We can't think (her expression changes to frustration as she walks away from him) of a single person in the world to do the job. (Cut back to a full view of the group as Toph walks around defensively) Now one shows up on a silver platter, (stomps her feet on the ground as the camera shakes slightly) and you (points to an accusing finger to Katara) won't even think (she stomps her other foot on the ground) about it? (Cut to a frontal shot of Toph's face as she groans in frustration and turns her back) I'm beginning to wonder who's really the blind one (walks out of the chamber) around here. (Cut to Toph as she earthbends a rock pillar in front of her as a form of protection from the fire) It's me! style=""mso-spacerun yes""> (Cut to the ground behind Toph's feet as the fire circles around the pillar. Toph takes a step back into the burning flames) Ow! You burned my feet! (Cut back to a frightened Toph as she uses her hands to push herself back) Get away (she throws a chunk of earth from the ground towards Zuko who is off screen) from me! Get off me, (she turns around and pushes Zuko away) get off me! My feet got burned. (annoyed) I just told you, my feet got burned. Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night. I just thought he could be helpful to us. And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out. Well, he did and he didn't. It was sort of an accident. Yes. Yeah, me too. (Aang and Sokka take her arms and lift her up) Maybe just invite him back here. He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once. Ahh, that's the stuff. Now I know how the rest of you guys feel. Not being able to see with your feet stinks. (urgent) He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side. (quiet for a second) Go ahead and let him join. It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet."
53,The Firebending Masters,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=313," (Cut to close-up shot of Aang who sighs and looks hesitant) Ok. Not something to fear. (he still looks unsure)  Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration?  (looks to the floor) I thought it was, (looks back at Zuko) nice. (shrugs)  Maybe it's the altitude. That one kind of felt hot.  Sorry Sifu Hotman. I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from (off screen) That's amazing, Toph. I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the Sky Bison. What do you mean? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty of Ok, ok. (moves his arm around in an appeasing gesture) I'm sorry.  (He comes into screen and joins Zuko) Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid.  It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.  Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start out our missions with a more upbeat attitude.  Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it. Whoa!(off screen) Ok, we learned something about architecture. (The camera pans around the various structures. Cut back to the duo.) Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too. The past can be a great teacher.  (frightened) Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me. There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here. Look. This seems promising. (Camera zooms out to reveal a carving of a person in the middle being surrounded by concentric circles of fire breathed out by 2 dragons on each side of him.) Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending.  I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors.  Zuko, something happened to the dragons in the last 100 years. Something you're not telling me.  But I thought your Uncle was, I don't know, good?  It's locked up. (exasperated) Monkey feathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long. Nothing's happening.  (picking up his staff) You know, Zuko, I don't care (Zuko sheathes his sword) what everyone else says about you, (nudges him) you're pretty smart. (scratches his head and reads the description at the foot of the statue) It says this is something called The Dancing Dragon.  (runs and grabs Zuko by his elbow) Zuko, get over here. I Just do it. (grabs and drags him away)  Let's follow the steps of the statues. Don't you see? (Camera cuts to the top-view of the room) These aren't dance moves. These statues are giving us a lesson. (both of them move in synchronization as he speaks) I think this is some kind of Sun (raises both arms in victory) Hurray! Wait. (rubs his head)What exactly is that?  Well, don't touch it! (raises his arms as a warning and Zuko stops in his tracks)  Remember what happened out there with those spikes (looks at the side and raises his arms) I'm just very suspicious of giant, glowing gems sitting on pedestals. (looks at the door closing) Oh, no, it's another trap!  (tries to budge the metal bars) I can't move. Zuko, do something! It stopped.  You had to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you? (opens his mouth widely) Help! Well, what do you think we should do? Please, I don't normally play this card, but... (looking confident and places a hand on his chest) I'm the Avatar. Just hear us out.  Ran and Shao? There are two of them? (unsure) Um, Mister Sun Chief, sir? Yeah... I'm not a firebender yet. Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me?  I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous. (he proceeds to gather it into his hands. The fire grows slightly and he looks relieved and in awe.) It's like a little heartbeat. I can't.(Places one hand on the rock) If I walk too fast, my (climbs up and looks worriedly at Zuko) But what if I can't control it? (interrupts) But once they find out I'm the Avatar... We could turn back now. We've already learned more about fire than we hoped. (shows Zuko that he can handle his fire and gives a weak smile)  What if they judge us and attack us?  What's happening? (whispers) Zuko, my fire went out. Give me some of yours. (He reaches for Zuko's fire and Zuko gently pushes him back)  I can't. (reaches for Zuko's flame)  (irritated) Quit being stingy! Uh-oh. (whispers) You still think we can take 'em? (whispers) Zuko, I think we're supposed to do The Dragon Dance with them. Well, I think they want us to do something. Let's just try it. Like firebending harmony. So, your Uncle lied. All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt(off-screen) With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I would be unstoppable. (cut to Zuko and Aang who are demonstrating The Dragon Dance and they're firebending at each step. They get into their final pose and the group applauds.) ", I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know... how it would have been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago?  (holding up her bowl and glaring daggers at Zuko) Maybe you're just not as good as you think you are.  That's ridiculous. (drinks the contents in the bowl)  Oh yeah? What's your little form called?," Hey, jerks. Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerk bending? (looking amused) Ok, take it easy. (drops his apple core, waves his hand in dismissal) I was just kidding around. (stands up to adjust his shirt) Jerk bending, still got it. (Zuko drops his head down and moans while Aang looks on)  (Cut to Sokka who enters comically into screen) So, all we need to do is make Zuko angry... easy enough. How's he supposed to do that? By jumping into a volcano?  So is it jumping into a volcano? (off screen) So, what? (Zuko and Aang turn their head towards the voice) Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing (moving his hand in a fluttering motion) where they stood 1000 years ago? Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there. We'll just tap-dance (moves his fingers in a dancing motion) our way to victory over the Fire Lord."," (off screen) I know you're nervous, (the camera stops and reveals Zuko and Aang standing at the balcony of one of the pagoda's) but remember... firebending in and of itself is not something to fear.  (Cut to Zuko crossing his arms) But if you don't respect it, (raises his voice, camera zooms in on his face to emphasize the point of treating fire with respect) it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino!  Now show me what you've got. Any amount of fire you can make. (Camera zooms up to show an aerial view of where they're standing) Good idea. You might want to take a couple steps back. (Zuko recoils back in confusion) What was that?! That was the worst firebending I've ever seen! (moves his hand in a ""What is wrong?!"" gesture)  (angrily) Why is this happening?! (turns away from Aang) Yeah, could be. (looks unsure and lost)  Just breathe, and... (pauses to firebend again.)  (lashes out) Don't patronize me. You know what it's supposed to look like! (throws his hand out)  (raises his arms and shouts) And stop calling me that! (Aang cringes)  Get out of here! (makes a ""Get lost"" movement with his arm)  Listen everybody; (everyone turns their head towards him) I've got some pretty bad news. I've lost my stuff. (drops his head dejectedly)  I'm talking about my firebending. It's gone. Well it's not lost. It's just weaker for some reason. I bet it's because I changed sides.  (bellows) Ok, cut it out! (Sokka stops what he is doing and his sword falls on his head) Look... even if you're right, (rubs the bridge of his nose) I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way. Well, this doesn't help me. The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct.  (defensive) Well, they aren't around anymore, ok? But maybe there's another way. (walks towards the fountain) The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors.  No, they died off thousands of years ago, but their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now. Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins. More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend, or the Avatar has to find a new teacher. (Aang looks worried)  We've been riding for hours. I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster. (He looks down and the camera zooms out to show Appa's underbelly. Appa growls.)  (in a low voice) I can't believe this. (sighs and rests his head on the boat)  Whoa!(off screen) Even though these buildings are ancient, (The camera is facing a vast plain of grass, it slowly pans down towards the ruins. Aang and Zuko are seen walking in a small ""valley"") there's something eerily familiar about them. I can tell the Fire Sages' temples are somehow descended from these.  (He kneels down and inspects the wire) I can't believe it. This booby trap must be centuries old, and it still works.  (dusting himself) Where's that upbeat attitude you were talking about? Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting.  They look pretty angry to me. (Cut to a close-up of the carving)  Well, they had a funny way of showing it.(he looks away and takes a few steps before he's interrupted by Aang)  My great-grandfather Sozin happened. He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory. They were the ultimate firebenders. And if you could conquer one, your firebending talents He had a complicated past. Family tradition, I guess. Let's just move on. Wait. (He steps aside to reveal the beam of red light resting on a circle on the ground) It's a celestial calendar. Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples. I bet that Sun Stone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits it at just the right angle, on the solstice. (Camera cuts to a red stone on the door)  No we can't. (unsheathes his broadsword and lays it in the path of the red beam.) But we might be able to speed time up. Let's see if we can outsmart the Sun Stone.  (Cut back to Zuko who is holding his sword in place) Come on... Relax. They're just statues.  (he pulls back his arm in shock) What? (Zuko gets into punching position and move into another position with his arms spread in a low arc above his shoulders.) This better teach us some really good firebending. It's some kind of mystical gem stone. (runs towards the pedestal)  Why not? It feels almost alive. Ugh, I can't pull free. It's like some kind of glue. (struggles again)  Me? I can't move either.  At least we have air. Maybe if we stay calm we can figure a way out of this. At least I made something happen. If it were up to you, we'd never Who are you yelling to? Nobody's lived here for centuries.  Think about our place in the Universe?  (Cut to Zuko who still has a small spot of goo on his chin) We didn't come here to take your Sun Stone. We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending. My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. Or at least, I (bewildered) I don't believe it. Hurry up. Your flame's gonna go out because it's too small. You're too timid. Give it more juice. You can do it. I know you can. You're a talented kid. No, we're seeing this through to the end. We're gonna meet these masters and find out what's so great about them.  Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar. (unsheathes his broadswords slightly to emphasize his point and smiles) I think we can take these guys in a fight, whoever they are. (Cut to Aang who nods but is still uneasy.)  (he steps forward with confidence) Bring 'em out. (whispers back) What do you want me to do?  No, just make your own. Get some from one of those warriors. (camera zooms out to gives a top view of what's happening. It seems like his whispers can be heard from the bottom) Hurry. Stop cheating off me! (his voice is raised and camera cuts back to the Chief who has seemed to have heard the commotion and exchanges looks with another warrior)  Uh-oh. These are the masters.  Shh. I never said that. What? What about this situation that you think they want us to dance?  Fine.(realization) I understand. Their fire was beautiful. I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined.  I can't believe there are still living dragons. My Uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it.  He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them. Yeah. It's like the Sun, (his hand curls into a fist) but inside of you. Do you guys realize this?  (extends both arms outward)  That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so many (defensive) It's not a dance. It's a firebending form. (walks towards Sokka) It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old! (embarrassed) The Dancing Dragon. ",," (cut to Toph who raises both arms to show she's innocent) Don't look at me. I didn't touch your stuff. (folds arms)  Ouch.  You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending (Sokka enters the screen, rubbing his head) from a different source. I recommend (swallows her food) No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is. I don't know. For earthbending, (Camera slowly zooms in on Toph's face) the original benders were badgermoles.  (voiceover) One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid in a cave.  That's where I met them. They were blind, just like me, (The badgermole moves away from Toph and she attempts to crawl after it) so we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending, (Cut to the top view of the badgermole which moves its paws in a sweeping motion) not just as a martial art, but as an"
54,"The Boiling Rock, Part 1",http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=314, I like jokes.  Nobody else has homework. (Cut to an overhead view of Aang as he proceeds to squat with his hands behind his head) One hot squat. Two hot squat. Three hot squat. Four hot... ," Sure. (Cut to an overhead of the group sitting around a fire) Right. Maybe that's because he remembers (grabs a cup) the whole thing.  Need meat. Gone fishing. (Turns the paper and her head as she tries to decipher the handwriting) Back in a few days. (Aang turns around and yawns.) Sokka and Zuko. One more thing. (Cut to an area in Aang's sleeping bag as he walks back) Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badger frog croak. (Aang lies down and proceeds to go back to sleep) Zuko. "," (Cut to Sokka who is sitting by himself at the side, thinking) Hey, can I talk to you for a second?  (Cut to the side view of the area as they continue to walk further into the dark) If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?  When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where (gestures both hands out) they might be.  What? Why not?  It's my Dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him Please.  (frowns slightly) What's that?  So where is this place?  Nothing. Boy, you're so paranoid. (waves his arm dismissively) Thanks Zuko. (yawns and pats Zuko's shoulder as he walks past) Just knowing makes me feel better.  Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my Dad. (puts back his belongings back into his bag) You happy now?  Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was my idea. It was my decision to stay when things were going wrong. (Cut to a side view of Sokka walking towards Appa as Zuko jumps off the bison) It's my mistake and it's my job to fix it. (Cut back to Sokka who looks determined) I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me Zuko.  (Sokka climbs up near the saddle) No. I have to do this alone.  (looks up) Pretty clouds.  What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons.  Yep. A balloon. But for War.  (nonchalantly) Yeah, it seems to run in the family.  I know, I know, you've changed.  (emphatically) I think your Uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us, that's hard.  (Cut to a side view of the basket) Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about? (He goes closer to Zuko with a surprised look on his face) That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?  (Cut back to Sokka who leans back on the basket) My first girlfriend turned into the Moon.  The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly.  (Cut back to Sokka who grabs onto the tank) I don't know. Crash landing? We'll figure something out. I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.  (Cut to a back view of Sokka walking towards the fallen vent) My Dad might be here. I had to come and see.  (Cut to an area inside the basket as Sokka turns back to Zuko) Hey! I never wanted you to come along in the first place. And for the record, (throws the fallen cloth into the basket) I always think things through. But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time I'm playing it by ear. So there.  It doesn't work anyway. (Cut to an area behind their heads as both of them look at the vent slowly going underwater) And we don't want anyone to find it.  We just need to lay low and find my Dad as soon as possible.  (whispers) We can't blow our cover. (Cut back to a front show of Chit Sang as the guard approaches him from behind) Super cute.  (whispers to Zuko) Meet back here in an hour.  (gets into the act) Prisoners. Am I right?  It sure looks cold in there.  (raises his visor) Zuko?  (Cut back to Sokka who is in shock) What? Are you sure? Did you double check? (Cut to an area on the ground behind Zuko) No. (holds his head in despair as he walks towards a wall) No! (bangs his fist against the wall in frustration) So we came all this way for nothing. I failed. (leans on the wall) Again.  Maybe we haven't failed after all.  No, what you said made no sense at all. But look, (points) it's Suki! (Cut to show an overhead view of the yard. Camera zooms in rapidly on Suki who is sitting on a rock) (crosses his arms) You mean you don't recognize me? (Cut back to Sokka who looks on smugly) Oh. Then maybe you'll recognize this.  (Cut to a side view of both of them standing up) The other Well, you (touches her face with one hand) won't be here for long, I'm busting you out.  You're under arrest! (Helps Zuko to his feet and whispers) Don't worry, I'll figure it out.  (crosses arms) Oh, good. You guys have met.  So listen, I think I have an escape plan. (faces the two and kneels while lifting his visor) I checked out the Coolers again, the whole point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?  So they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well to keep the cold in it also has to keep the heat out, right? It's a perfect boat (he left arm moves across his body in a fluid motion) for getting through the boiling water.  (Cut back to Sokka) I'm telling you, it'll work.  (voice over) I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot (cut to Sokka's point of view as he looks up to see the guard tower slowly disappearing from sight from the area under the cooler building) between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point. I already tested it out. (Cut to Sokka kneeling down. Cut to his hand letting go of a small boat made of paper) We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current. (Sokka looks on as the boat sails with the current) It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound, (Cut back to present day Sokka) no one will notice. And bing, bang, boom we're home free.  (panics) What? (making various gestures) We didn't. We... We didn't say that. (waves arm dismissively)   Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is... an egg? (Zuko and Suki sigh at Sokka's lame attempt to hide the truth) Okay, you're in. Now, first we need someone (he reaches to his pocket) to unbolt the Cooler. (he hands a wrench over to Zuko) From the inside. (Zuko puts it into his pocket) (walks in and raises his voice) I need backup over here.  I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.  (smiles and lifts his visor up as he whispers) I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore.  I know. (looks away and closes his eyes)  (shakes head) I don't know. (looks towards Zuko with tears in his eyes) Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom? All of our (Cut back to Sokka who looks annoyed and struggling against the weight of the cooler) Fine, everybody in the cooler. Let's go.  (Cut to Sokka who looks up at them in desperation) If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.  (stands up as he slings is bag over his shoulder while raising his eyebrows) That's supposed to make me feel better? (walks away) Seriously, not helping.  No, I'm staying. (drops his bag as he turns around and address Zuko and Suki) You guys go. (places a hand on Suki's shoulder) You've been here long enough.  (Cut to inside the cooler looking at the trio as they shrink in the distance) We gave up our only chance of escaping. (Cut back to the trio) I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.  The plan failed! They're caught.  The gondola's moving.  This is it.  If my Dad's not there, we risked everything for nothing.  (Cut to a close up of Sokka's anxious face) Come on, come on.  (looks back at Zuko) My Dad doesn't have a nose ring.  (Cut back to Sokka's blue eye staring up at the scene) Where is he? (Cut back to Sokka who is looking on with disbelief) That's it? That can't be it.  Oh no. (lowers his head in dismay) Dad."," (Cut to a tray full of tea cups with Zuko's hand holding a kettle and filling up the empty cups) No one can make tea like Uncle. (Camera pans up to Zuko's face) But hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?  Okay. (Cut to Zuko kneeling between The Duke and Haru) Well, I can't remember how it starts but the punch line (the boys help themselves to the tea) is, ""Leaf me alone, I'm bushed."" (They give a dead panned look. Cut to show the rest of the group giving Zuko the same look as well) Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.  So (Appa wakes up and looks at them) what's up? What do you mean? Who was captured?  I can't tell you.  Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse. (He turns around and Sokka grabs his shoulder) It's not good Sokka.  (closes his eyes) My guess is... (opens his eyes) They were taken to the Boiling Rock.  (off screen) The highest security prison in the Fire Nation. (Sokka's mouth goes slightly agape) It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake. (Sokka turns towards the camera, folds his arms and looks serious) It's inescapable.  Why do you need to know? What are you planning? (warily) It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here.  Yeah, I'm sure it does.  Not up to anything, huh? I'm never happy.  You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you.  How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, (Cut to a back view of Sokka) prisons don't have bison day cares.  We'll take my war balloon.  (raises head) Yeah, fluffy.  (turns towards Sokka) What?  No kidding.  There's one thing my Dad's good at, (turns back to the tank and firebends) it's War.  Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that.  I meant my Uncle. He was more of a Father (Cut to Zuko who looks saddened) to me. And I really let him down.  It wasn't that hard.  Well I did have a girlfriend. Mai.  (Cut back to show Zuko grinning goofily) Yeah. (his face turns serious) Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it.  (looks up) That's rough buddy.  There it is.  There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet we should be able to navigate through it without being caught.  We're going down. The balloon's not working anymore!  So what are we supposed to do? How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?  (looks at Sokka as he walks away) You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?  Uncle always said (Sokka proceeds to gather more of the vent and places them into the broken basket) I never thought things through, but this, ugh, (grabs his head) this is just crazy. (Cut to a front shot of Zuko as he throws out both arms) What are you doing?  I hope you know what you're doing. (Both of them turn around) There's no turning back now.  I hope these disguises work.  (Sokka's eye looks toward Zuko nervously) Uh, yeah, very cute sir.  But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared someone could (Sets his plate down and sits with them) Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison? (Cut to a side view of Zuko) No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals right? So what about war prisoners? Hey there, fellow guard. How goes it? (raises his finger to his mouth) Shh. Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no (makes the gesture with his hands) Water (Cut back to Zuko) Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm really sorry Sokka.  Err, (holds his chin in thought) what would Uncle say? (He looks to the sky. Cut to an area at Zuko's feet looking up at him as he stares at the clouds) Sometimes clouds have two sides, a dark and light. And a silver lining in between. It's like a silver sandwich. So... (Cut back to Sokka who appears disinterested) when life seems hard... (Sokka looks to the side and his eyes widen) take a bite out of the silver sandwich. (Sokka smiles and rushes to the railing.) That's the spirit. I can't believe (folds his arms) that worked. I didn't even know what I was saying.  No, you can't go in there. (looks into the opening of the cell door) The lights are out... the prisoner (points to the door) could sneak up on you. (Cut to the female guard who frowns) (Cut back to Zuko's side view) How did you know who I am?  (stands straight) You're Mai's uncle? (Cut to Zuko's guilty stricken face) I never meant to hurt her.  So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my Father and collect the reward.  We did? (looks up and thinks) Oh. Sorry about that. Nice to see you again. (They put their mops against the wall as they sit down. Sokka checks his surroundings before joining them) Yeah...  (Cut to Zuko and Suki who look at each other sceptically) The cooler as a boat? Are you sure?  Yeah, you heard wrong.  There's nothing to get in on.  Hey, you watch who you're shoving. (he pushes Chit Sang) (lifts his head up and sighs a breath of fire) Yes, I have. Completely.  Someone's coming.  (Cut to a concerned Zuko) War prisoners. It could be your Father.  Well, what should (shrugs) we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night? It's your call Sokka.  (Cut to a side view of the scene as Suki and Zuko look on) Are you sure you want to go? (walks to Sokka as he slings his sword) You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your Dad is your chance.  (Cut back to Zuko) No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out.  Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again. (Sokka stops in his tracks) (grabs Sokka's shoulder) You have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail.  (comes into screen) I'm staying too.  (off screen) Is that him? ",, Bring it. (Zuko stands up with his tray) It's nice to get a chance to relax a little. (Zuko walks between Toph and Teo and hands them their drinks.) It hardly ever happens. (They proceed to drink their tea) What does it say? 
55,"The Boiling Rock, Part 2",http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=315, (Cut back to the welcoming party) Sounds like a crazy fishing trip. , What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon? (Cut to Katara who tears up) Dad. (she runs towards her Father)  (Cut to Sokka's back as he looks on. Katara lets go) How are you here? What is going on? (looks at her brother) Where did you go?," Dad. (He rushes from the stairs and nudges some guards aside) Excuse me, coming through. The Warden wants me over there (points) sorry.  Thank goodness you're okay. (walks towards his Father) (lifts his visor) Dad, it's me. (points to self) Yeah, (rubs his neck) I ran into that problem earlier.  So where's Bato? (Cut back to inside the cell) Where's everyone else from the invasion? You mean the Kyoshi Warriors? Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us.  And you know Prince Zuko? Well, he's here too.  Actually, he's on our side now. (Cut to Hakoda who looks at Sokka sceptically) I know, I had the same reaction. After all he has done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself and I never would have found you without his help. (Camera zooms out on the pair as Hakoda nods his head)  We had one (looks away) but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it. (sets  his head on his knees) I don't know if Then we'd better find two.  Zuko, are you there? I just got done talking to my Dad. We came up with an escape plan together.  (Cut to an area behind the 2 guards) I was just (pointing to the door) telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him! (looks to Zuko's cell door and back) Why?  (Cut back to Sokka who smiles) Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit? (punches his right fist into his left palm)  (off screen) Take that! And this!  (whispers as he punches) We have a new plan but it's gonna need a big distraction.  I don't have much time. (Cut to the outside of the opening looking into the room) If I'm seen with you (Sokka looks out of theopening) the guards might think something's up. (he lowers his visor before pushing back up again) I just talked to my Dad.  Yeah and we're escaping today. On the gondola.  My dad and I came up with a plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola and (places both hands on Suki's shoulders) we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.  My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.  Not if the Warden is the captive. (A sound from outside the cell stops their conversation. Sokka peers at the opening.) I have to go. (Suki rushes into screen and hugs him) I'll find you before we start the riot.  (turns back) Why?  Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow? (he walks off) (He enters the screen) Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard.  Oh, okay. (he waves his hand dismissively and walks off) I'll just go tell the Warden you said that. I'm sure (the guard raises his visor) he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority. (Sokka comically enters back into screen, raising his visor) What's your name again? (The guard perspires nervously as Sokka disappears off screen)  (Cut to an overhead shot of the room) Hey, I'm confused too. (turns< back to the guard) But the Warden's in a bad mood and irrational. So if you ask me, (puts an arm on the guard's shoulder and turns him towards the controls) it's best not to question it and just do what he This is it. We have to start a riot.  This isn't working.  Actually, we're trying to escape right now. But we need a riot. (points to Chit Sang) You wouldn't happen to know how to start one would you? Zuko, good. We're all here. Now all we need to do (points to the top of another tower) is grab the Warden and get to the gondolas.  (looks back at Zuko) I'm not sure.  (in hysterics) I thought you told me it's okay not to think (looks at Suki) Tell me about it.  (Cut back to inside the gondola) What are you doing?  Way to think ahead.  (Cut to a front shot of Sokka who looks out of the opening) Who is that? (Sokka stops and looks back at Zuko who pauses in his tracks, thinking) Zuko, what are you doing? Yeah and she's probably right behind us. So let's not stop.  (Cut to a close up of Sokka) I did. (closes his eyes) The best meat of all. (opens his eyes) The meat of friendship and fatherhood. (Cut to Sokka) We... kind of went to a Fire Nation prison. "," (Zuko's eyes appear at the door's opening) I'm here.  What are you doing? Where are you taking me? I didn't do anything wrong.  (Cut back to Zuko's surprised face) Mai.  How did you know I was here? (he looks up to her) But... how? (Cut to Zuko who looks at her apologetically) I didn't mean to...  (harshly) Stop! (looks back at Mai) This isn't about you. This is about the Fire Nation.  (Cut to a side view of the couple) Mai, I never wanted to hurt you. (gets up from his chair and faces Mai) But I have to do this to save my country.  (Cut back to Zuko) That's not how I see it.  (Zuko laughs slightly) Hah, believe me. She doesn't.  And how do we do that? Argh, I thought you thought this through.  (Cut side view shot of the argument. Zuko has his fists clenched.) Maybe not everything. But this is kind of important. (Zuko grabs his head. While Sokka puts his finger on his chin in thought.)  Back off, we've got the Warden.  Let's go.  I'm making it so they can't stop us.  (off screen) That's a problem. (the guards proceed to bow in respect) It's my sister and her friend.  Me too.  They're cutting the line. The gondola's about to go! (Cut to a shocked Zuko) It's Mai.  My sister was on that island.  What I mean is she must have come here somehow. (He runs to the edge of the rocks and looks down) There. (Cut to an area looking up at the edge of the cliff) That's our way out of here.  (Cut to Zuko) It kind of got destroyed. "," I did. (Ty Lee can be seen behind her) (walks in some more) Who is this? You're wasting your time. (turns and walks to the door) That's not one of them.  (Cut to Azula) Because I'm a people person.  (Cut back to Azula's face) Then it's time to leave. (She smiles and propels herself from the roof with her firebending. Cut to Azula sailing through the air, looking down at the roof.) Goodbye Zuko.  (Cut to a furious Azula) What is she doing?!  (off screen) Leave us alone.  (Cut back to Azula) I never expected this from you.  The thing I don't understand is why (lifts her head up) Why would you do it? You know the consequences.  (outburst) No, you miscalculated! You should have feared me more! (Camera pans to Azula on the floor as she glares at them furiously) You're both fools.  (Azula's head comes into screen) Put them somewhere (Camera slowly zooms in on Mai and Ty Lee who have unreadable expressions on their faces) I'll never have to see their faces again. (Cut back to Azula) And let them rot. "," Did you at least get some good meat? (Cut to an overhead view of the scene as the camera slowly zooms out) Seriously, you guys didn't find any meat? "
56,The Southern Raiders,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=316," What are you doing? (Cut back to Aang who looks on, stunned) Zuko, no!  (Cut to a side view of the 3 outside the tunnel as they tug the reins to no avail) I can't get him to go in there. Appa hates tunnels. We'll have to finda way. (they loosen their hold on the reins) (Camera pans down to Appa's head) We'll get through, let's go. Wow, camping. It really seems like old times again, doesn't it  Here, here. (Toph and Aang nudge Zuko with their elbows) (feeding Appa hay) Why? Is it your turn to take a little fieldtrip with Zuko? (Cut to Aang who is surprised) Oh. What's going on? Umm... and what exactly do you think this would accomplish?  (Cut to a close up of Katara as Aang and Sokka look on behind her) Wait, stop, I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do you think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people? I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge.  Katara, you sound like Jet.  The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed ratviper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself.  Katara, you do have a choice. Forgiveness.  (shakes head) No it's not. It's easy to do nothing. (Camera slowly zooms in) But it's hard to forgive.  (Aang & Sokka climb over the rock) So you were just going to take Appa anyway? It's okay, because I forgive you. (smiles< hopefully) That give you any ideas? I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. (Katara nods and she climbs on Appa's horn to his head) But when you do, please don't choose revenge. (Zuko throws his bag into the saddle) Let your anger out and then let it go. Forgive him.  Thanks, Sokka. (narrows his eyes) I appreciate that.  (turns his head towards Sokka rapidly) Why do you need Momo?  (off screen) Katara! (Camera pans up to show Aang and Zuko approaching her) Are you okay? (Cut to a frontal shot of Katara with the boys behind her as the camera pans up) Zuko told me what you did. (He rubs his head) Or... what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you. (off screen) You did the right thing. (Cut to a side view of the port) Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing. (Katara stands up and walks towards Aang) It never is."," What are you doing?! Okay, I'm not crushed. You can get off me now.  (Cut to a close up of Katara as their arms tremble against Appa's resistance) Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here.  (Cut to Katara who turns her head back) No, (Cut to a side view of Katara as she walks to Hakoda) the Fire Nation can't separate our family again. (Cut to a close up side view of Katara who looks down sorely) Haha. (Cut to Katara who glares at him) Yeah, no kidding. (Cut to an overhead view of the group as she stands up and leaves) (Cut to Katara's back as she turns around and snaps) Oh, everyone trust you now? (places hand on chest) I was the first person to trust you, remember Back in Ba Sing Se. (points to the ocean) And you turned (Cut to Zuko who looks down guiltily) around and betrayed me. Betrayed all of us.  You really want to know? (walks towards Zuko) Hmm, maybe you could re-conquer (Cut to Zuko's unscarred side who looks on speechlessly) Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. Or, (Zuko steps back as Katara's head pops into screen) I know. You could bring my mother back.  I'm going to find Mum. (She runs past her brother. Sokka runs the other direction) (Cut to a side view of the scene) You look terrible. (She >ignores him and rummages through her bag) What do you want? I need to borrow Appa.  Yes, it is. We're going to find the man who took my Mother from me.  (sighs and shakes her head) I knew you wouldn't understand. (She begins to walk away) (off screen) Fine! (Cut to an angry and frustrated Katara) Maybe it is. Maybe that's what I need. Maybe that's what he deserves.  (defensively) It's not the same. Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster.  Then you didn't love her the way I did. (Camera zooms out to place Katara on screen) Now that I know he's out there, now that I know we could find him, I feel like I have no choice. (Cut to Katara who looks on darkly) It's not just hard, it's impossible.  Yes. (Cut to a side view of the scene. Zuko is also wearing the same outfit as Katara and is packing his bag.) Don't try to stop us.  (Cut to Katara looking down at Aang from Appa's head) Thanks for understanding Aang. Yip yip. (Appa takes off. Cut back to an area behind the guys as they look up at the departing bison) (off screen) So once (Cut to a communication tower in the middle of the ocean as the building slowly becomes bigger as they near it) we find the communication tower, we bust in and take the information we need.

(off screen) Just let her go and (Cut to Katara's Mum who pleads) I'll give you the information you want. (Cut to an area behind her Mother's shoulder as Katara looks on, frightened) Mum, I'm scared. (assuringly) Go find your Dad, sweetie. I'll handle this.  (Cut to a desperate Katara running in the snow) I ran as fast as I could.  (shouts) Dad! Dad! (Camera pans down to show Hakoda throwing a firebending soldier hard into the snow.) Please, I think Mum's in trouble! There's a man in our house.  But, we were too late. When we got there, the man was gone. (voice cracks slightly) And so was she.  (Cut to a front shot of Katara as she touches her necklace) I know. (Cut to Katara bringing down the telescope) Let's do this.  (eyes widen in shock) It's not him. (Zoom out on the scene as Katara drops her hands. The Captain falls back to the floor. Cut back to Katara who looks back, somberly) He's not the man.  That was him. (Cut to Katara's eyes as they shine with hate) That was the monster. Do you know who I am? Oh you better remember me like your life depends on it! (Yon  Rha places his arm in front of his face) Why don't you take a closer look.  (Katara holds her hands together) Mum, I'm scared. She lied to you. (Cut to a close up of Katara as she closes her eyes sadly) She was protecting the last waterbender. (Cut back to Katara who opens her eyes and looks back furiously) ME! (Cut to Katara who looks on, pityingly) I always wonder what kind of person could do such a thing. But now that I see you, I think I understand. (She walks forward) There's just nothing inside you. Nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty.  (Cut to a visibly angry Katara) But as much as I hate you... (Her eyes start to shimmer with emotion) I just can't do it.  (Cut to Katara's back) I'm doing fine. I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him but, I couldn't. (closes her eyes sadly) I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or if it's because I'm strong enough not to.  (Cut to a frontal shot of a serious and still angry Katara) But I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him. (Her face softens as she looks up at Zuko) But I am (Camera pans to show Zuko's back as Aang turns his head towards his teacher) ready to forgive you. "," (grabs Aang's shoulder) Come on, we gotta get out of here.  We need to split up. (runs towards the group in the tunnel) Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.

(Cut to Sokka's point of view as the rest except Katara raise their cups) Here, here. (Toph and Aang nudge Zuko with their elbows) (raises an eyebrow) What's with her? What's with him? (turns his head with a rose in his mouth) Well, hellooo. (His eyes widen as a comical sound effect plays and he swallows the rose. Cut to a sideview of the scene as Zuko still has the sweatdrop expression and proceeds to sit in front of Sokka) Uh, Zuko. Yes, (sits up) why would (chews the flower) I be expecting any one different? (He swallows the flower with a pained expression and coughs out some petals) So what's on your mind? Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. (moves his hand across in an arc) Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation. (his  eyes widen as he realizes what he just said) No, I mean, uh, not people who are good but used to be bad. (makes pacifying gestures with his hands) I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are so bad, who have never been good (places his arms in a X shape) and probably won't be ever! (opens it to the side) (Cut to a stunned Sokka) What? Why would you want to know that? (looks to the side sadly) It's not a day I like to remember.  (voiceover) Many of the warriors (Cut to 3 Fire Nation ships closing in on the village) have seen the black snow before (Cut to Sokka and a few other adult warriors armed with clubs who run towards the ship) and they knew what it meant. (Cut to a line of Fire Nation soldiers) A Fire Nation raid.  (Cut to the soldiers and warriors who begin to fight) We were badly outnumbered. (The warriors throw the soldiers off their feet before they start to firebend) But somehow, we managed to drive them off. (Cut to a soldier being thrown towards the place Sokka is hiding. His head gets stuck in the snow. Sokka throws snow on his back and uses the soldier's back as a stool to reach the ground. Cut to a boomerang on the ground as Sokka picks it up. He runs towards the ship but stops. The other warriors in the background stop as well.) As quickly as they came, (Cut to a back view of Sokka as the soldiers run back to their ships) they just left. (Cut back to Sokka who throws his boomerang. Fade back to present day Sokka.) I was so relieved when it was over but, that's because I didn't know yet what have (Cut to Sokka as he thinks) Yeah... (Flashback to 3 red Fire Nation flags with raven symbols on them) Sea Ravens. The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them. (Cut to present day Zuko) No problem. (places an arm around Zuko's shoulder) Thanks for stopping by. (pushes the tent opening aside and shoves Zuko out and sighs) Thought he never leave. (hopeful, optimistic music plays as Sokka smiles and rubs his hands together and pushes the tent opening aside. Cut to the outside of the tent as his head pops out) Suki.  Katara, she was my Mother too. But I think Aang might be right.  (speechless) Katara... You know, you're pretty wise for a kid.  Usually it's annoying but right now, I'm just impressed.  So... can I borrow Momo for a week?"," (pushing her out of the way) Watch out!  Keeping rocks from crushing you. I'll take that as a thank you.  (Camera zooms out to show Zuko isn't evacuating) Go ahead, I'll hold them off. I think this is a family visit.  (Cut to Zuko and camera slowly zooms out on him) What are you doing here? She's not going to make it.  Of course she did. (Cut to Zuko who breaks a biscuit in half) If you really want to feel like old times, I could, uhh... chase you around a while and try to capture you.  (smiles warmly) I'm touched. I don't deserve this. (stands up) I wish I knew. (He walks off as the others look at him quizzically) This isn't fair. (puts  both arms out) Everyone else seems to trust me now. What is it with you? (swipes one arm to the side) (raises head) What can I do to make it up to you?  (Suki walks away) Sorry. Do you need to talk to Sokka too?  Your sister, she hates me and I don't know why! But I do care what she thinks of me. (interrupts) Stop. Okay, listen. I know this may seem out of no where, (Cut to a serious Zuko as the camera slowly zooms in) but I want you to tell me what happened to your Mother. Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se and again just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow... she's connected her anger about that to her anger at me. Wait. Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village Like, what the lead ship looked like? The symbol of The Southern Raiders. Thanks, Sokka. (stands up and rubs his eyes) I waited out here all night. (Katara proceeds to comb her hair) (Cut to a close up of Katara with Zuko behind her) I know who killed your Mother. (she widens her eyes and stops combing) I'm going to help you find him.  (off screen) Sokka told me the story of what happened. I know who did it. And I know how to find him.  (off screen) She needs this, (everyone turn their eyes towards him) Aang. This is about getting closure and justice.  That's cute. But this isn't air temple pre-school. It's the real World.  That's the same as doing nothing.  (Cut to Zuko who appears to be tired of his preaching) Okay, we'll be sure to do that guru-goody-goody. (He climbs aboard Appa) (off screen) We need to find the Fire Navy communication tower. (Cut to Zuko leaning on the saddle) All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk. And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed.  (off screen) Not exactly. (Appa flies into screen just above the water and it airbends with its tail to propel it forward. It displaces some water below.) We need to be stealthy (Cut to the communication tower as camera pans down to show the whole building structure and a bunch of rocks below) and make sure no one spots us. Otherwise, (Appa flies into screen and lands) they'll warn The Southern Raiders. Long before we reach them.  Okay,Southern Raiders. (He pulls out a black scroll and unrolls it on a table. It's a map a mountain terrain with 3 flags placed along some points in an inverted triangle.) There. (His finger points to the flag on the top right) On patrol near Whale Tail Island.  (Cut to a front shot of Katara with black circles under her eyes and holding Appa's reins tightly) You should get some rest. We'll be there in a few hours. You'll need all your strength.  (Cut to a sorrowful Zuko) Your Mother was a brave woman. There! (Katara's head pops up from the saddle) See those Sea Raven flags? (He throws the telescope to Katara. Cut to the inside of the telescope looking at a lone ship in the ocean. Cut to the Sea Raven flag.) It's The Southern Raiders.  This is it, Katara. Are you ready to face him? (Cut to Zuko remaining in a stance and Katara looking on vehemently behind him) You don't remember her? You will soon. Trust me.  Think back. Think back to your last raid on the Southern Water Tribe.  (Camera zooms out to show Zuko kneeling near the Captain's head) Don't lie! You look her (points back to Katara) in the eye and you tell me you don't remember what you did. (Cut back to Zuko) What?! What do you mean he's not? He's a leader of The Southern Raiders! (The Captains stirs behind him) He has to be the guy!  If you're not the man we're looking for, who is?  We weren't behind the bush. (Cut to a side view of the confrontation as Zuko takes a step forward to threaten Yon Rha.)  (off screen) You were right about what Katara needed.(Cut to Zuko and Aang who smiles) Violence wasn't the answer.  Then I have a question for you. (He turns towards Aang and the camera cuts to a close up of Zuko) What are you going to do when you face my Father?", (Cut to Azula) You mean it's not obvious yet (opens  her arms out) I'm about to celebrate becoming an only child! ," (turns back and points to the tunnel) Come on, we can get out through here! (Cut to an area on the ground looking at Appa as Aang climbs onto his horns onto his head) I can clear that away and we can fly out through there.  Here, here. (Toph and Aang nudge Zuko with their elbows)"
57,The Ember Island Players,http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=317," Hey, uh... I wanted to sit (points at Zuko's spot) there. (he clenches his hands together) I was (Katara looks at the commotion and looks back to the stage) just... I wanted to... (sits next to Zuko) Okay. (giggles and balances tip toed on one leg) I'm the Avatar, silly. Here to spread (pirouettes on her balancing leg) joy and fun.  (in disbelief) Wait, is that a woman playing me?  (She kneels down and places an arm around actor Sokka's shoulder and points to the ceiling above the audience) But wait. (Cut back to Aang who is visibly unamused and is slumped against the railing) Is that a platter of meaty dumplings?  (giggles uncontrollably) Did I mention (crosses her legs) that I'm an incurable prankster?  (irritated) I don't do that. That's not what I'm like! And... I'm not a woman! Hey look, (the tail slinks deeper into the bush) I think (she tip toes towards the bush and reaches in. Cut the Water Tribe actors as they look at each other, puzzled.) I found something. (Cut to actress Aang who steps away from the bush with a large puppet of Momo sitting on her shoulder) It's a flying rabbit monkey. I think (she walks closer to the camera) I'll name him, Momo. (giggles) My hero.  (enthusiastically) Look, (points down) it's The Great Divide. (Actress Katara looks down) The biggest (laughs) The Avatar is back to save the day! Yay! (off screen) At least this Sokka actor kinda looks like you. (Cut to Aang sitting at the bottom of the steps with Toph standing in front of him) That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all. Yeah. (sits down) That's not you at all. I better (she opens a mini glider prop in her hand) have a look around to see if I can find an earthbending teacher. (A rope attached to her back pulls her up) I flew all over town but I couldn't find a single earthbending master. (Actress Katara and actor Sokka act horrified and sad) (points to actor Toph) Who are you?  So, you're blind? If she continues drilling (the prop drill continues to penetrate in), this wall (Cut to actress Aang as the wall beneath her shakes and sways unsteadily) will come down for sure.  (off screen) No, Jet! (Camera zooms out to show the actors appearing horrified and scared at the scene. Actor Jet is crouching like a primate and he has a slight pot belly.) What did they do to you?  Avatar State, yip yip.  No, I'm not. (He throws his hat on the ground. Cut to the ground as the hat lands.) I hate this play. (He turns towards Katara and goes into an outburst) Overreacting? If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State (raises his arm to the sky) right now.  (off screen) Katara, (Cut to the back view of the two) did you really mean what you said in there? (He turns, crosses his arms and leans back against the railing) (Cut to a close up of an irritated Aang) On stage. When you said (clenches his fist) I was just like a brother (throws his arms towards the theatre) to you and you didn't have feelings for me. (he place his hand on his chest) But it's true, isn't it? (Cut to a close up of a depressed Aang) We kissed at the invasion and I thought we were going to be together but we're not. Why don't you know?  (Cut to a close up of an impatient Aang) Well, when is the right time? (He turns his head towards the camera and raps his head several times) Argh! (He brings his head down to the railing) I'm such an idiot! I wouldn't want it (She swings her arm across her body happily) any other way.  We finally made it to the royal palace but no one's home.  (points her staff towards actor Ozai) Yeah and now, (points her free hand down) you're going down.  (Cut to a close up of actress Aang who twirls and circles within the cloth) Nooo... I'll say."," (Cut to a close up of the 2 girls. Toph is napping.) Doesn't it seem kinda weird that we're hiding (looks around the courtyard) from the Fire Lord in his own house?  (Cut to an area behind Sokka as he shows the poster to his sister) What? (He shows the poster to Aang) How is that possible? (Cut to a close up side shot of Katara as she turns back to her brother) Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?  Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening. (sighs) Sokka, my only brother. We constantly roam these icy South Pole seas and yet never do we find anything fulfilling.  Is food the only thing on your mind?  Everyday, the World awaits a beacon to guide us, yet none appears. Still, we cannot give up hope. (she places her hand to her chest in a melodramatic way) For hope (she sniffles) is all we have (her voice begins to be choked with ""tears"") and we must never relinquish it. Even... (sniffling) even to our dying breath.  (Cut back to the Gaang's viewing box as Katara is unamused) Well, (Suki and Sokka laugh) that's just silly. I don't sound like that.  (Cut to a full view of the stage as the iceberg prop slowly moves to the centre of the stage. A cut out of Aang sways from side to side on a stick inside the iceberg.) It appears to be someone frozen in ice. Perhaps for a hundred years.  (Cut to actress Katara who is already on top of the iceberg prop. Actor Sokka is still climbing up) Waterbend, hai-ya!  Who are you, frozen boy? (gasp) An airbender. My heart is so full of hope that it's (drops to her knees) making me (grabs actress Aang's leg and cries) tearbend. Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on. It just gave me so much hope! (sultrily) Oh Jet, you're so bad. (off screen) Relax, Aang. (he turns around and camera cuts to Katara sitting at the top of the steps) They're not accurate portrayals. It's not like I'm (places hand on chest) a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time. (Camera zooms out to show a full view of the stairs at everyone looks at her skeptically) What?  Well, here we are in the Earth Kingdom. (Camera pans to the right to show Katara who attempts to make fun of Toph) Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth. It hurts, doesn't it? (They turn back to the empty corner) She escaped. But how? I have to admit, Prince Zuko. I really find you attractive. But I mean it. (Sheproceeds to sit down beside actor Zuko) I had eyes for you (Cut to Katara and Zuko who look at each other awkwardly and they slide away from each other) since the day you first captured me. (Cut to Aang who frowns and looks serious) (laughs) The Avatar? (stands up and walks towards actor Zuko) Why, he's like a little brother to me. (laughs some more) I certainly don't think (Cut to Aang who looks saddened and his eyes turns towards Katara) of him in a romantic way. Besides, (Cut back to the stage) how could he ever find out about this.  You didn't really say that, did you? (Cut to the end of the corridor looking at the group as Katara walks in) Does anyone know where Aang is? I'm going to check outside.  (Cut to a frontal shot of Aang with Katara behind him) Are you alright? (Cut to a back view shot of Katara as she walks forward) I know it's upsetting but it sounds like you're overreacting.  (turns her head towards Aang) In where? What are you talking about?  (Cut to a close up back view of the two as Katara turns her body towards Aang) I didn't say that. An actor (She gestures her arms towards the theatre) said that. (She places her right hand against her left elbow) (Cut to an area above Aang's head as an unsure Katara turns back to the ocean) Aang, (shakes her head) I don't know.  (seriously) Because we're in the middle of a war and (folds her arms and looks towards the theatre) we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time.  (Cut to a close up of Katara who is deep in thought) Aang, I'm sorry but right now, (she tugs at her hair and closes her eyes) I'm just a little confused.  (annoyed) I just said that I was confused. (Cut to a confused Aang. Cut back to a visibly displeased Katara) I'm going inside.  I just want to let you know Aang, that I'll always love No kidding. "," (Cut to an area behind the girls looking at the boys as Sokka and Suki walk into screen) You guys are not going to believe this. There's a play about us.  (He flips the poster back) Listen to this. (Cut to a frontal shot of Sokka with the back of the poster facing the camera) ""The Boy in the Iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu On Tim who scoured (Cut to the poster as camera pans up on the main characters with heavily exaggerated features. Sokka is pictured as a muscled man in his Season 2 outfit) the globe gathering information on the Avatar from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se. (Cut to an overhead shot of the scene) His sources including singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage.""  Come on, a day at the theatre? (Unrolls the scroll towards his sister) This is the kind of wacky time wasting nonsense I've been missing.  (Camera pans to the right to show Sokka's actor who is buck-toothed and thinner than the actual Sokka. His ""wolf-tail"" is an overly large ponytail bun.) All I want is a full feeling in my stomach, I'm starving!  Well, I'm trying to get it out of my mind and (Cut to a close up of actor Sokka as he points to his mouth) into my mouth. I'm starving.  This is pathetic. My (points his thumb to himself) jokes are way funnier than this. (throws out his arm towards the stage) (Cut to a close up of the cut out.) But who? Who is the boy in the iceberg? My stomach is so empty that it's making me tearbend. (He drops to his knees and grabs actress Aang's other leg and sobs) I need meat. (Cut to a close up of actor Sokka) (off screen) Ooo. (Cut back to the 3 actors as actor Sokka looks around) Where? Where?  (He walks backwards into screen, sticking his rear end out as he does so) Does this dress make my butt look fat?  Why did you have to steal that waterbending scroll?  (looks down and throws his arm to the side dismissively) Meh. Let's keep flying. Don't go, Yue. You're (grasps her hands) the only woman whose ever taken my mind off of food. (Cut to a close up of the 2 as they kiss audibly. Actress Yue has an overly large and exaggerated white hair wig and she is wearing pink instead of white. Actor Sokka gags and sticks his tongue out.) Wait, did you have pickled fish for dinner?  (places a finger on Suki's lips) Shh. I'm trying to watch.  (Cut to Sokka's legs walking down as Suki look on, amused) Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot (he sits down and reaches into a small bag of food) who tells bad jokes about meat all the time. (he takes out strip of meat) (swallows) I know! (takes another bite angrily) You know, it was really unclear.  (whispers) Oh, you're getting up? Can you get me some fire flakes? (He lays his arm across Suki's shoulder as she rests against him) Oh and (He releases his arm to whisper back as Suki appears irritated at the sudden gesture) fire gummies.  (Cut to a close up of the couple as Suki smirks) You're one to talk, Suki. Didn't Azula take you captive? That's right, she did. (She frowns and acts serious) (matter-of-factly) I'm just saying.  He left to get me fire gummies like, 10 minutes ago. (He leans against the wall and folds his arms impatiently) And I'm still waiting. Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage I got some jokes I want to give to the actor >me.  Can I help you? (Cut to actor Sokka's point of view as Sokka smiles sweetly) Actually, I think I can help you. (points to actor Sokka) I'm a big Sokka fan but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be. (Cut to a side view shot of the scene.) Oh no... (brings his hand to his head) another fan (turns and walks away) with ideas. (Sokka swiftly steps in front of him, blocking his path)  (He places both arms out in front of him) Just hear me out. Here's something (He rummages through his belt and pulls up several cue cards) I think the real Sokka would say. (He shuffles through the cards and picks one card out from the pile and clears his throat) ""What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages?"" (He smiles and thrusts his arms out in a 'Ta-Dah' motion) ""A cabbage patch.""  (He laughs and Suki is surprised) That's actually pretty good. (Cut to a frontal shot of Sokka who smiles and offers the cue cards. Actor Sokka's hands come into screen and take the tiny slips of paper.) Let me see those. (Cut to an area behind Sokka looking at the 3 of them) Haha. Rocky relationship. Not bad.  (Sokka ducks off screen and appears at actor Sokka's side, holding his shoulder) Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases. (Both of them begin to walk off screen) Especially before an attack. Something like ""Flying Kick-A-Pow!"" (Cut to an area behind Suki's legs looking at the 2 departing boys) Who are you, anyway? I'm just a guy who likes comedy.  (Camera pans out to a whispering Sokka) Here's what you missed. (He counts the scenes with his fingers) We went to the Fire Nation and you got better and Katara was the Painted Lady (Cut to the back of Katara's head as the camera slowly zooms in) and I got a sword and I think Combustion Man died. (Cut back to Sokka and Aang) Ooo look, The Invasion's (Aang lowers his head down to his knees) about to start. Shh. Hey Toph, would you say you and Aang have a rocky relationship? (Sokka lifts Aang's hat up) I told him to say that.  I hope everyone's ready for The Invasion. (thrusts his arms out in a stance) Slop-A-Pow!  (Cut to the ""Gaang"" with actor Sokka poised in an attacking position) I guess (he lowers his boomerang prop) we have no choice. Come on.  I guess that's it. (He stands up and stretches) The play's caught up to the present now.  But it is over. (He puts his hand on his chin in deep thought) Unless... (Camera zooms in on his face, his face lights up mysteriously and spooky music being to play) This is the future. But the effects (waves his arms out matter-of-factly) were decent. "," (Cut to Zuko sitting at the fountain, wiping his hair with a yellow towel) I told you, my Father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy. And that was a long time ago. This is the last place anyone would think to look for us.  Ugh. (Cut to a close up of Zuko with a disgusted look on his face) My Mother used to take us to see them. They butchered ""Love Amongst The Dragons"" every year.  (lowers his hood) Just sit next to me, what's the big deal?  (Camera pans to the right to show actor Zuko in Zuko's Fire Nation armor with a long ponytail. His scar is on the wrong side.) I don't have time to stuff my face. (His voice is rougher and deeper than Zuko's. He lowers the telescope and faces the audience) I must capture the Avatar to regain my honor! You sicken me. (He looks through the telescope again) (Cut back to Zuko with Katara looking very amused) They make me (looks to Katara and stretches both arms out) How could you say that? (turns back to actor Uncle, outraged) How could you say that?! The Avatar is mine! (he looks to the side and points) Wait, who's coming? So far, this intermission is the best part of the play.  Maybe it's best if we... (He turns his head away) split up.  Azula! My sister. What are you doing here? (All 6 actors turn towards the audience as actress Azula opens a door and escapes) Where?  Did Jet just... die? You don't (actress Katara cringes at his harshness) have to make fun of me.  (Cut to Aang's back view as he grabs the railings, looking at the stage) Wait. (actor Zuko stands up) I thought you were the Avatar's girl. I hate you, (points to actor Uncle) Uncle. (actor Uncle sits up) You smell and I hate you for all time. (turns his head away) I might as well have.  You don't get it. (He looks up at Toph who leans against the wall smiling to herself) It's different for you. You get a muscley version of yourself taking down 10 bad guys at once and making sassy remarks.  (Cut to a close up of Zuko whose face is full of regret) But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life and shove them back in my face. (Cut to behind a pillar in front of them as the camera slowly pans to the right to show the 2 of them) My Uncle. He's always been on my side even when things were bad. He was there for me. He taught me so much and how do I repay him? (Cut to the side view of Zuko's unscarred side) With a knife in his back. It's my greatest regret (lowers his head, ashamed) and I may never get to redeem myself.  How do you know? Really? Oh, sorry. Ow. (rubs his arm) What was that for? The scar (points to his face) is not on the wrong side!  Actually, (another spotlight shines on him) I'm home and (Cut to a close up of actor Zuko still in his Season 1 outfit but his hair is spiky.) I want to join you.  Aang, you fight the Fire Lord, I'll hold her off. (Actress Aang gets pulled up by the rope) (Cut to a close up of actor Zuko) No, (points towards actress Azula) I am the rightful heir to the throne!  (Cut to a close up of his silhouette as he drops to the floor) Honor! That... wasn't a good play. (Cut to frontal shot of the group as they walk off screen in single file with Zuko in the lead. All of them have unhappy looks on their faces)"," (Cut to a close up of actress Azula with pink torso armor instead of red and like the other female actresses, she has heavy eye makeup) You caught me. Wait. What's that? (points to the ceiling above the audience) I think it's your honor. (Camera zooms out to show a full view of the stage) (Cut to actress Azula who swipes the rock prop away with her arm) Haha, yes! Continue drilling. (points towards the wall) The city (Camera zooms out to show the black clad stagehand fanning to create a smoky effect. The other stagehand continues to shake the wall) of Ba Sing Se can't hide no longer.  Well, my brother. What's it going to be? (Cut to a close up of actor Zuko has he makes several gestures of confusion and deep thought) Your nation or a life of treachery?  No way!  (Cut to a close up of actress Azula who whips out a blue streak of cloth. Various parts of her armor are glowing in the dark.) Not if my lightning can't help it! The Avatar is no more! (Actress Azula comes into screen and kneels before the throne prop) Father, Zuko and the Avatar are at the palace. They're (She points both arms offstage) trying to stop you. (She points towards actor Ozai)  (Cut to a close up of actress Azula) You are no longer my brother. (clenches her hands) You are an enemy. (Cut back to actress Azula who smirks slyly) We'll see.  It is over, Father. (raises her arms victoriously) We've done it."," (Cut to an undershot of the viewing box as Sokka and Suki sit in the row behind the 4 of them) Why are we sitting in the nose bleed section? My feet (the lights in the theatre dim down) can't see a thing from up here. (Toph laughs and the siblings look at her) I think he's got you pegged. (giggles and clutches her stomach) Oh man, this writer's a genius.  (laughs out loud as the rest turn to look at her) Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes.  I don't know, you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys. (He stands up and makes an annoyed sound) Listen, friends. It's obvious that the playwright did his research. I know it must hurt but what you're seeing up there on that stage is the truth.  (excitedly) This is it! This must be where I (Zuko brings a parchment closer to his face while Katara looks on worriedly and Sokka appears bored) come in. (clenches her fist in anticipation) Here it comes.  (Cut to the stage as a rock prop gets lifted by a well built man wearing Toph's outfit who appears from a trap door under the prop) You can't find an earthbending master in the sky, you have to look underground.  (spits off camera) My name is Toph because it sounds like tough. (He flexes his muscles) And that's just what I am. (Cut to Toph who turns her head to side, straining to hear the words.) Wait a minute, (She uses her pinkie to clear her ear) I sound like... (shocked) a guy. A really buff guy. (She smiles) (grins from ear to ear) Are you kidding me? (Katara appears annoyed at the revelation) I wouldn't have cast it any other way. At least it's not a flying bald lady. (laughs) I can see you doing that. (points to actress Aang) I see everything (Cut to a full view of the stage) that you see except that I don't see like you do. I release (Cut to a frontal shot of actor Toph) a sonic wave from my mouth.  There. (The leading trio look on, impressed) I got a pretty good look at you. Jeez. Everyone's getting so upset about their characters. Even you seem more down than usual and that's saying something. Yeah, that's pretty great. (Camera pans to the right slightly as Toph sits down) You have redeemed yourself to your Uncle. (Cut to a frontal shot of the two) You don't realize it but you already have. Because I once had a long conversation with the guy and all he would talk about was you. (Zuko lowers his hood and smiles) Yeah, and it was kind of annoying. But it was also very sweet. (Cut to an area above Toph's head as the camera slowly zooms in on a smiling and happy Zuko) All your Uncle wanted was for you to find your own path and see the light. Now you're here with us. ( Cut back to a frontal shot of them again) He'd be proud. (Toph proceeds to give him a punch on the shoulder)  (Cut to Toph who smiles) That's how I show affection. You said it. "

(he begins to run towards the house) (raises both arms) Check out my Appa sand sculpture. (Camera zooms and shows the real Appa growling at the sight. Toph walks into screen.)  Whoa. (he looks at the sand replica of Earth King Kuei and his bear, Bosco) Wow, you even made a little Earth King and Bosco. Is that a blubbering, blob monster?  But it doesn't even look like...  What are you doing?! Get a grip before I blast you off this roof! (furiously) Enough! About Sozin's Comet... (takes a step forward) I was actually going to wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came. I'm not ready. (looks unconfident and unsure) I need more time to master firebending. What am I going to do?  Why (points to self) didn't you tell me (turns around and walks off screen) about your Dad's crazy plan sooner? This is bad. (places both hands on head in despair) This is really, (shakes his head and drops to his knees) really bad. (Cut to a close up of Aang whose face is full of worry and despair) Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together. But I wouldn't want to do it any other way. (The group laughs and they engage in a group hug but Zuko remains standing where he is) That's like waterbending. So... Have you ever redirected lightning before? What did it feel like? (Zuko stops whatever he is doing and does a cool down motion with his hands) Heh. (laughs nervously) Well, not over over, right I mean there's always Katara and a little spirit water (moves his hand in a watery movement) action... Am I right? (turns to Katara) Oh. Yeah... I'll just do that.  (shakes head) I can't. I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself. But he is still a human being. (Everyone looks at him as the camera pans to Aang) No, I agree with you. Fire Lord Ozai (stands up and faces the group) is a horrible person and the World will probably be better off without him. There's gotta be another way.  (shrugs) I don't know. Maybe (raises both arms as if he was holding a bowl) we can make some big pots of glue and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore. (naively) Do you really think that would work?  (drops his head and sighs) This goes against (paces up and down, looking at his hands) everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like...  (Cut to Aang's back as he rapidly turns around and bursts out) This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understands the position I'm in!  (rudely interrupts) Just what, Katara?! What?  (Cut back to Aang) Then when you (points at Katara) figure out a way for me (brings his hands back to his chest) to beat the Fire Lord without (makes a ""no"" gesture with his arm) taking his life, I love to hear it! (Raises his arms in exasperation and walks away.)  Hey, Momo. (pats Momo's head) I don't suppose you know what I should do. (Cut to Momo who makes a sound) I didn't think so.  (The tattooed head turns around) Avatar State, yip yip! (Actor Toph lifts her up in the air as she poses in a flying position as the crowd cheers wildly.  (groans from sleepiness) Hey Momo, (sits up and rubs his head. Momo is clutching Aang's head protectively as it looks around) I just had the strangest dream. (He opens his eyes with a surprised look on his face and surveys his surroundings. He turns his head towards the ocean) Wait...  (off screen) Where are we? "," Who wants a nice, cool glass of watermelon juice?  What happened? What's wrong with you?! (Aang jumps off the balcony and lands near the group.) You could have hurt Aang. The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the war. But they pretty much won the war when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse. (drops her head in worry) I can't believe this. (shakes her head) (off screen) Aang, you (Cut to a side shot where Katara is standing behind Aang. He looks up at her) don't have to do this alone. (Toph and Zuko walk into screen) Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.  (matter-of-factly) Actually I used it all up after Azula shot you. I have a surprise for everyone! Er, no. (All 4 of them suddenly start to shove rice into their mouths) I was looking for cooking pots in the attic and I found this. (Throws scroll downwards as it unrolls by itself.) Look at baby Zuko! (Camera zooms onto the scroll and reveals a baby smiling happily with his arms in the air, enjoying himself at the beach.) Isn't he cute? (off screen) Oh lighten up, I was just teasing.  Aang, we do understand. It's just... (Cut back to Katara who is visibly annoyed) We're trying to help.  Aang, don't walk away from this. (She begins to walk towards him as a hand touches her shoulder to stop her from doing so.) Maybe he was captured. Then he's gotta be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him. (Cut back to Katara who staring calmly at her brother) Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang.  (Cut to the girls who are looking up at him) What should we do Zuko?  (In the background, Sokka slides out of Appa's mouth and his entire body is covered in Appa's saliva.) (Cut back to the rest) Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang.  (observing warily) And the reason you brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?"," (off screen) Maybe Zuko's right. (Cut back to Sokka.) Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know (lays his watermelon aside and stands up slowly) just the thing to change that. Beach party!  Ta-da!  No, (stomps the ground defensively) it's Suki. (Cut to Aang with an animated look of shock and surprise on his face as both he and Toph burst into a fit of laughter.)  Zuko's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki (tries to pick up the fallen sand to mould the sculpture back into shape) and he destroyed it! Oh, and he's attacking Aang.  Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord right now, he's gonna lose. No offence. I always knew that the Fire Lord was a bad guy but his plan is just pure evil. (Suki shakes her head) Alright! (raises arm in enthusiasm) Team Avatar is back! (points confidently) Air. (Cut to Aang) Water. (Cut to Katara) Earth. (Cut to Toph) Fire. (Cut to Zuko) Fan (picks up a palm leaf in a shape of a fan from the ground into Suki's hands) and sword! (He thrusts a blade of leaf into the air. The background music makes a comical sound and the tip of the leaf falls) Alright. (off screen) Gather round Team Avatar. (Cut to a watermelon with some face carvings resembling a jack-o-lantern being dropped onto a wooden structure with a red cloth draped over it. Camera zooms out to reveal Sokka standing in front of the Melon Lord and the rest of the group walking towards him and proceeding to sit in a circle) In order to take out the Fire Lord, or in this case, the ""Melon Lord"", our timing has to be perfect. (He kneels down) First, Suki and I will draw his fire. (He takes a stick and draws a line curving to the left towards the melon symbol on the ground) Then, Katara and Zuko (He draws a straight line in the middle) charge in with some liquidy hot offence and while the ""Melon Lord"" is distracted, Aang swoops in and ""BAM!"" (He draws a line curving to the right which runs through the melon symbol) He delivers the final blow. (Cut to who Aang stares at the drawing with slight disgust) (off screen) For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces. Whatever makes the training feel more realistic. (shakes his fist) Watch it, Toph! (Cut back to Sokka who is running with his sword. Flaming rocks are being sent over his head continuously) Now, Aang! What's wrong with you? (points accusingly at Aang) If this was the real deal, (points at Aang again) you'd be shot full of lightning (he makes a beheading gesture against his neck) right now.  (off screen) There. (Aang opens his eyes in shock) That's how it's done.  Sure, you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance, (Aang balls up his fist as he struggles to contain his temper) I'm pretty sure the Universe will forgive you. Okay, that's everything. (his gloved hand grabs the staff) He left his staff. That's so strange. Look! There's his footprints. (Camera pans up to the path of footprints leading to the sea.) The trail ends here. I don't think so. There's no sign of a struggle. Ah-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa.  It's pretty obvious. (stands up and throws his hands to the side) Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey. (His finger points up in an ""I got it!"" position) (slumps) Oh yeah, forgot about that. Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang either. (Cut back to the steps as Sokka jumps and lands in front of them) (turns around in horror) Oh no! (kneels down and camera cuts to the top view of Sokka who is behaving hysterically) I knew it was only a matter of time. Appa ate Momo! (Cut to Appa as Sokka jumps in and lifts Appa's jaws to peer into his mouth) Momo, (Cut to the inside of the mouth with the camera looking at Sokka) I'm coming for ya, buddy (Sokka climbs onto Appa's tongue and tries to crawl his way in.) (Cut to outside Appa's mouth as he turns around and looks at his sister) That's just what Appa wants you to think. (He climbs further in and Appa closes his mouth around Sokka's legs as they flail around.) Zuko, I don't want to tell you how to do your job but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there.  (off screen) Oh yeah (Cut to a close up of June's eye) that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole.  (off screen) No, (June deftly dodges and spins away with her tea cup still in hand. ""Ryu"" continues to fight) she has this giant mole creature she rides around on."," More ferocious!  Imagine striking through your opponent's heart.  Now let me hear you roar like a tiger-dillo!  That sounded pathetic! (Cut back to Zuko lashing out) I said roar! Hey, (Zuko's hand comes into screen and holds Aang back by his robes) your lesson's not over yet! (Aang tries to break free of his grip and his tongue comically sticks out to show that he is thirsty.) Get back here.  Fine.  If you want to lounge around (Cut to the top of the steps to show Aang running towards Katara and accepting the watermelon with glee and proceeds to slurp the juice noisily and greedily) like a bunch of snail-sloths all day, then go ahead! (Zuko turns and walks away)  (Cut to Zuko's boot stopping in the sand. Cut to Zuko's face.) Teaching you a lesson!  Go ahead and do it!  What's wrong with me? What's wrong with all of you! (Cut to Zuko's front view as he stands up and throws his arm to the side in anger) How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet (Camera slowly pans through the rest of the group who have guilty looks on their faces) is only 3 days away!  Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy?  After?  So... You all knew Aang was going to wait?  You're wrong. (turns head towards camera) It's about to get worse than you can even imagine. (voiceover) The day before the eclipse, my Father asked me to attend an important war meeting. (Zuko's servants help him wear and tighten his armor shoulder pads as he walks towards the room) It was what I dreamed about (the servants bow in respect) and wanted (Cut to Zuko standing in front of the war room's curtain entrance) for so many years. My Father (Camera slowly zooms in on Zuko's back and he raises both hands) had finally accepted me back. (Cut to the opposite side of the curtain as Zuko thrusts the curtain apart, revealing his presence. He walks forward. Cut to the top of Fire Lord Ozai's throne to show the whole room. There is a map of the Earth Kingdom spread out on a table with generals seated around the length of the table.)  (Cut to the front view of Zuko as he drops his head and thinks) The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything as long as they have hope.  (Cut to a side view of Father and son) Well, that's not exactly what I... (Cut to the sideview of Zuko's scarred eye as he looks down) I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan. (Cut to an area behind Zuko's head as it slowly zooms in on the back of his head. The generals are still applauding and Ozai basks in the excitement.) But I'm ashamed to say I didn't. (Cut back to present day Zuko) My whole life I struggled to gain my Father's love and acceptance. (Cut to show the whole Gaang looking at Zuko who is sitting on a rock) But once I had it, I realized I lost myself getting there. (Katara raises her hand to her forehead in despair) I forgotten who I was.  I know you're scared. (he stands up and walks towards Aang) And I know that you're not ready to save the World. But if you don't defeat the (takes a step forward) I didn't think I had to. I assumed that you were still going to fight him before the comet. No one told me you decided to wait!  There's one technique you need (Cut to a close up shot of Zuko standing in front of Aang. Katara and Momo sit at the side, spectating) to know before facing my Father. How to redirect lightning. (Aang grins with anticipation) If you let the energy in your own body flow, (He stretches his left arm out and the fingers on his right hand touch the fingers on his left hand and swiftly traces a path down his arm, shoulder, stomach and back out the other side) the lightning will follow it. (His left hand touches his right, they are parallel to each other) You turn your opponent's energy against them.  Exactly. My Uncle (Aang begins to mimic Zuko's movements) invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders.  Once. Against my Father.  Exhilarating. (Cut to a flashback of Ozai throwing lightning at Zuko and he re-directing it back during their confrontation in ""The Eclipse"") But terrifying. (Cut back to Aang who has raised both arms eagerly to his chest but his face falls when Zuko says those two words) You feel so powerful (Aang's hands drops back to the side. He slouches with disappointment) holding that much energy in your body. But you know that you make the wrong move, it's over. (stares at Aang seriously) You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life. Before he takes yours. (Cut to the group who are hiding behind a rock behind him) What are you waiting for? Take him out! (Camera slowly pans to Aang who looks unwillingly to perform the action) (opens his eyes) That's not me. It's my Father. (Camera zooms out to show them again as Katara rapidly rolls the scroll) Well that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster. And the worst Father in the history of Fathers. You're going to defend him? (off screen) Like what? (sarcastically) Yeah. Then you can show him his baby pictures and all those happy memories (everyone starts to laugh and snicker) will make him good again. (seriously and sternly) No! Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself. (Cut back to inside the house. Everyone runs up the steps to the corridor and looks around.) Aang? Aang!  Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach. (He turns his head towards the beach and the camera zooms in onto the ocean. Cut to a broken docking area on the edge of the sea as 2 seagulls fly pass. The remaining of the Gaang can be seen near the shore as black shadows. )  But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?  Uh-huh. (Cut back to Zuko who turns around and looks at her) Look, I know you had a rough childhood but we should really focus on finding Aang. (Cut to the top view of the scene with 2 white birds feeding on a branch. Zuko walks on.) No. It's like he just... disappeared.  (off screen) Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka. (Cut back to Zuko who is not looking very pleased) We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only 2 days away.  (stands up) I don't know. (Cut to the rest who continue to stare at him) Why are you all looking at me? (Cut back to Zuko who looks around)  (Cut to Zuko's unscarred side as his eye is shown looking back at Sokka) Just trust me.  June.  (Cut back to the group standing at the doorway) Her shirshu. (groans can be heard from the fight) It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the World. It's the one shot we have of finding him."," (interrupts) I think you should take their precious hope (fingers her fringe and tosses it aside without a care) and the rest of their land, (looks at the table fiercely) and burn it all to the ground.  Come on slowpokes, faster!  Sorry I'm late, Father. Good palanquin bearers (Her eyes look to the side< menancingly) are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure? (turns her head to the side leisurely)  (She turns her head back and her eyes widen in shock) What?  (whines and begins to behave like a spoilt child) But I thought we were going to do this together.  (Cut back to Azula who looks very unhappy) You... (Stands up and talks back to her Father) you can't treat me like this. (Her face scrunches up into anger and annoyance) You can't treat me like Zuko! (Throws her head forward to make her point) (Cut back to Azula who whines even more) But it was my idea (clenches her fist towards herself) to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side!  (looks up in disbelief) Really? (Cut to a close up of her face) Fire Lord Azula? (Her face suddenly looks happy and turns her head to the side) It does seem appropriate. But, (turns her head back) what about you? "," Not bad, baldy. But I've been working on my sandbending (stretches and cracks her fingers) You're gonna love this. Try and top that, Sokka. Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this. And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too. (Aang looks disappointed) Yeah. (Suki and Sokka join in) If we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down.  Yeah. Err... (Camera shifts to the right) what about me?  So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you? Sweetness. (smiles) Muahahahahahaha!  (Cut back to Toph who is clearly enjoying herself) I am not Toph, I am ""Melon Lord""! Muahahahahaha! (Cut to Toph holding her chopsticks in her bowl of rice) I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru!  (Cut to Toph's back view. She is sitting on some stone steps) No, it's not. (Everyone turns to face her) Where's Aang? (Cut back to the rest who look surprised and run off to look for him. Cut to Appa who eats his hay nonchalantly.) Come on lazy bones, let's go.  (bends down) I bet he ran away again. Then what do you think happened to him oh sleuthy one? (grabs Zuko's arm swiftly and he blushes) I'm going with Zuko! (Camera pans out to show the rest looking at her curiously) What? Everyone else went on a life changing fieldtrip with Zuko. Now it's my turn. (She hugs him tighter and Zuko is still blushing) (Cut to some beach houses and camera pans down to Toph in her Fire Nation outfit & Zuko walking around) And then when I was nine, I ran away again.  I know I shouldn't complain, (Closes her eyes and opens her hands to the side. Zuko appears disinterested and looks away.) my parents gave me everything that I ever asked for. But they never gave me the one thing that I really wanted. Their love. You know what I mean? (Zuko drops his head and sighs audibly) (Cut back to Toph who looks disappointed) This is the worst fieldtrip ever.  (sits up) Hey, wait a minute, has anyone noticed that Momo's missing too? (In the background, Sokka is seen standing up and trying to rub off the spit.) Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar,(Sokka takes a step and slips as he hits the ground with a very loud groan) it's you. (Cut back to Zuko's scarred side as he looks down. Cut to the ocean near dusk as Appa flies swiftly towards some dark clouds.

Maybe I'm in the Spirit World (Cut to Aang walking under the log still looking up at the canopy) But wait, (Momo crawls onto the log behind him) you can see me. We can both (Cut to a close up of Momo as it stares at Aang curiously) be in the Spirit World.

(Momo jumps on Aang's shoulder and curls its tail around his neck) Maybe if we climb (Camera pans up a slope) to the top of the island we could figure out where we are. It's a hexagon.

I wish I had Roku. I do have Roku.  (looking around) So where am I, Roku? What is this place?  I am. (He puts on a serious face) I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord.  Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life but I just don't know if I can do that.  Avatar Kyoshi, I need your wisdom.  (voice over) But you didn't really kill Chin, (A memory of Chin falling to his death is shown) technically he fell to his own doom because (Cut back to present day Aang) he was too stubborn to get out of the way. I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi.  I need to look deep inside myself.  (off screen) All these past Avatars, (Cut to a frontal shot of Aang with Momo beside him) they keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it. They don't get it. (Momo stands on Aang's lap and makes some animal noises. Aang turns back to his furry friend.) You're right, maybe an air nomad Avatar would understand where I'm coming from. (Cut to a close up of Momo's puzzled face as it purrs. Cut back to a frontal shot of Aang as Momo jumps to Aang's other side.) I know you can't really talk. Pretending you can just helps me think.

(off screen) Avatar Yangchen, the monks always (Cut to a close up of Aang who raises his shoulders and looks at the surrounding trees) taught me that all life is sacred. Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web.  (Cut to Aang who appears optimistic since someone finally shares his views) I know, I'm (points to self) even a vegetarian. I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever and I've only had to use violence for necessary defence and I've certainly (shakes his head) never used it to take a life. But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the World so my spirit could be free.  (He looks at Momo) I guess I don't have a choice, Momo. (He looks up towards the sky and Momo ears droop) I have to kill the Fire Lord. Wait, (Switch to Aang's point of view as some mountains at the edge of the sea increase in size) is it just me or are those mountains getting bigger?  They're not getting larger, they're getting closer. (Aang jumps off screen. Cut to a side shot of Aang hopping across the forest floor with Momo flying closely behind him.)

Even you fear me. What are you waiting for? Do it!  (laughs) You're hilarious.  Wait. You want to be Fire Lord Fine. Let's settle this. Just you and me, brother. The showdown that was always meant to be. Agni Kai! I'm sorry it has to end this way, brother. Oh, I'LL SHOW YOU LIGHTNING!"," Too bad the Fire Lord is about to use it to destroy the World. Then we're taking off too. Where's the closest airship?  Ugh. That's how it's done. (sarcastically) That's a great idea! Let the blind girl steer the giant airship. That would make a lot more sense.  And how do we do that, Captain Boomerang? I can't see outside of this floating hunk of metal.  Whoa. That's a lot of fire, isn't it? Sokka, I think we've gotta...  Jump!"
61,"Sozin's Comet, Part 4: Avatar Aang",http://atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php?num=321,"  (his voice is mixed together with the previous Avatars) Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now (Ozai looks on frightened) you shall pay the ultimate price.  (Camera pans across Aang's face to show Ozai kneeling behind him) No... I'm not going to end it like this. I took away your firebending. You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again. I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away. (matter-of-factly) A giant Lion Turtle. (Cut to a close up of a smiling Aang) And now we're friends. I can't believe a year ago (stands up and faces Zuko) I was still frozen in a block of ice. The World's so different now."," (Cut to Katara who tears up) I think I'm the one who should be thanking you. Dad!  That's very thoughtful of you Sokka. (She looks down and her expression changes into a deadpanned look) Wait! (Cut to a crude drawing of a waterbending Katara with ""floopy ears"". Toph looks like the drawing from her wanted poster in The Runaway and Zuko has long spiky anime-like hair.) Why did you give me Momo's ears?"," Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in the turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others. (surprised and joyful) Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending? (grimaces) My leg! (He looks through the U-shaped opening) Hang on Toph! Bye Space Sword.I don't think Boomerang is coming back, Toph. (Toph tears up) It looks like this is the end. (looking up and smiling) No, (Cut to show smiling Suki hanging from a harness near the rudder of the airship) Suki did. You did it! You should have seen yourself, it was amazing! (He lifts his arms from both girls shoulders and stands on one leg, lifting his bandaged leg off the ground) You were all like, (he proceeds to make several punching gestures) ""pshoom, pfoom, pfoom, phish, whoom"", and then the Fire Lord was all like, (he pretends to choke himself) ""eugh, eh, eh, eh, eugh, aye"". (mocking) Well, look at you buster. Now that your firebending is gone, I guess we should call you the ""Loser Lord"". Dad! (off screen) There's my favorite warriors. I have to admit, (Camera zooms out to reveal 2 more warriors standing behind Suki) I kind of missed the face paint. How does it feel to be back in uniform again (Ty Lee cuts through from behind Suki)  (He stands in front of Suki protectively while pointing his crutch towards Ty Lee) Careful Suki! Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again. Zuko, stop moving! (Katara, Mai, Suki and Zuko look towards Sokka in surprise) I'm trying to capture the moment. (Cut to a frontal shot of Sokka looking serious) I wanted (His face softens and he carries on with his work) to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together. (He sticks his tongue out comically as his sister walks into screen) (off screen) Those are your hair loopies.  (Cut to a frontal shot of the table) I thought it looked more exciting that way.  Oh, you (Everyone turns to look at Momo) think you can do a better job, Momo?","(whispering weakly) Thank you, Katara. (Cut to a delighted Zuko) Mai! (Walks off screen) You're ok. (Cut to an area behind Mai's back as Zuko opens his arms out in a hug) They let you out of prison?  So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?  I can't believe a year ago my purpose in life was hunting you down, and now... Yeah...we are friends. (Camera pans out to an area directly in front of the curtain looking at the 2 boys.) (Zuko walks towards Aang and places a hand on his shoulder) And it's gonna be even more different, when we build it together. Please, the real hero (He moves aside to reveal Aang walking towards him) is the Avatar.  Today, this war is finally over. (Cut to Haru, Tyro,Teo and The Mechanist as they smile and the Fire Nation citizens behind them cheer) I promised (Cut to a serious Zuko) my Uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation, and I will. (Camera pans across the back of the heads of the crowd) The road ahead of us is challenging. A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided. (Cut to a side view of Aang as he turns his head towards Zuko) But with the Avatar's help, we can get it back on the (Camera pans to the right to show Zuko looking at his friend) right path, and begin a new era of love and peace.You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life. (Cut to a close up sideview of Ozai as he makes a ""Hmph"" sound. Camera slowly pans to the right to reveal Zuko) Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life. (Cut to an overhead shot of Ozai's cell) It put me on the right path; perhaps your time in here can do the same for you. (off screen) Because you are gong to tell me something. (Camera zooms in towards Zuko's robe and he kneels down into screen) Where is my mother? At least you don't look like a boarcupine. (Cut back to the drawing again showing more of the group. Zuko is drawn next to an angry Mai. Further to the right, Sokka is depicted thrusting his sword into the air behind Suki) My hair's not that spiky!"," I'd really rather our family physician look after (Cut to Katara looking up as she gets off the ground and turns away) little Zuzu if you don't (Cut to Azula who has made wide arcs of lightning around her) mind! (off screen) Zuzu, (Cut to an area behind Katara looking at Zuko) you don't look so good!  There you (Cut to a frontal shot of haggard and angry Azula) are, filthy peasant!"," Got it.  You could stand to mention it more. Aye aye, Captain. How did that happen? Did Boomerang come back?  (Sokka and Toph widen their eyes with surprise) Wow, who taught you that? (She crosses her arms and Sokka walks off screen) You have the craziest adventures when you disappear. Oh sorry, didn't mean to offend you ""Phoenix King of (punches her fist into her palm) Getting His Butt Whupped."" (Ozai simply blinks, closes and opens his mouth. It seems he has temporarily lost control of his body) Leave the nicknames to us (points to herself) honey. Well, I think (raises her arms into the air) you all look perfect!"
